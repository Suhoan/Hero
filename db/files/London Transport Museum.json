It is well done with interactive displaces and a good progression throughout the history of London public transport. Covers the growth of London and various forms of public transport, which are very much interlinked. Horse powered, trains, tube, buses, trams, river - all the forms. Does well with the space it has. Plenty for kids to do. The display on posters currently on is quite good. Can be busy and only criticism is a bit pricey.","time":1701159603,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Sadek Miah","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102600358755038994628/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXavxBaDxlGbEmBcWd8O-oqGEilUZRxQLL2WAN85RmSHS2L=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"London Transport Museum will appeal to those who have a love for London's transport and the rich history that surrounds it - as well as little ones as there's a myriad of things to see and do here.
