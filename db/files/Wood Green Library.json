Next to lots of amenities, restaurants, superstores, malls etc.\nQuiet inside - not disturbed by the outside busy roads.\nVery kind, friendly and helpful staff.\nHas printing facilities, toilets ðŸš», large lifts and stairways with a paid parking space behind the library. Haringey uses part of the ground floor on week days for its customer service.\nHas a youth library and adult learning classes on the second floor.\nHas a sizeable computer room, private reading room and a children's library on the first floor.\nOn the ground floor, it has rows of books in one side, quiet areas to read, side room (Business Lounge) for private event which I've used to host a Women's History Month Talk. The business lounge has computers, white boards, white screen for projectors as can be seen in the pictures. It can fit upto 25 people I believe.\nIt also has a large space on the ground floor which can be booked for events like exhibitions or launching or talks. I've also used this space for my book signing events as can also be seen in the picture.","time":1683014974,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Andi Cheese","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115052928350967165014/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVhuyrotENLcLpK6jC89NastOeF4ffEsrb21jQGyHgif6cX=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6","rating":2,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"Look at the previous reviews and see that:\n\n1) They cannot be asked to respond to any form of criticism or any reviews.\n\n2) Nothing gets done to improve the things people are most concerned with.\n\n3) It is not really fir for purpose.\n\nI concur with the reviews that shine a negative light over this service but it is well deserved. The toilets are horrendous, totally disgusting and unhygienic. The counter service is slow, inadequate and are not really helpful when machines are down or cards don't work  The book selection is abysmal and study books are far and few between. The soft chairs look like they have been brought in from a flood drenched tip that was also neglected for 100 years.\n\nYou could save a bit if money, if that is one factor, by getting rid of the security there. I would love a job of sitting on the stool inside the entrance playing in my phone all day. What a great job, getting paid to text your chums and watch YouTube videos.\n\nIt's not a great reading environment and noisy people are allowed to be noisy, I suppose it would distract the security from playing on their phone if they really had to sort people out and walk around checking all is well\n\nI use a library in the city now as the local one is not fit for purpose any longer.","time":1699100683,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Turts Mama","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103853211413369889203/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXgUbEvlw5I0wGMuNok7TpIZFVMQCuavSSCc1vAkarPMg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":2,"relative_time_description":"3 weeks ago","text":"The security guard is rude and shouted at me today.
