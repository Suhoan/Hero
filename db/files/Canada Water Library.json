The quiet/study space is not quiet at all, it should be separated from the general area which gets as loud as a playground. It's more of a nursery for kids and teenagers than a library. For a new building the interior looks very dated, with little selection of books, non-fiction in particular. So overall not a good investment of our council tax and more of a vanity building.","time":1696003714,"translated":false},{"author_name":"mario jose moreno santana","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110535237621809577857/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKm7qnuAq4OzRDhwNsspK7j5RO0OcynSHoFF-hC-KtI=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":2,"relative_time_description":"2 weeks ago","text":"Hi ,Nice looking Library with great staff and few dont talk to me.
