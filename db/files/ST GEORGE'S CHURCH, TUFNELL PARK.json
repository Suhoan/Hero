I was passing this church the other day and I had an idea so thought I would talk to one of the staff about it. On reading the 10 commandments, I realised that we really don't have much of a problem with graven images these days so I suggested to the 'Big Enchilada' who works there that we replace it with \"Don't deep fry all your food\", he looked at me aghast and invited me to leave. He seemed unwilling to make even a slight change to help his fellow men.  It really made me wonder, if the Bible was written by the creator of the Universe, how good a book would THAT be? But it does seem to be obsessed with ritual animal slaughter and desert nomad feuds.","time":1518189401,"translated":false}],"user_ratings_total":28,"website":"https://www.stgeorgestufnellpark.org/"},"status":"OK","place_id":"ChIJed011AkbdkgRk3-2s9CqBog","categories":["stay and play"],"address":"Crayford Rd, London N7 0ND, United Kingdom"}
