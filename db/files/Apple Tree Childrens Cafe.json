We just hosted a party here and it's a great venue for under 5s, with easy catering and clean-up included. Only issue was that they didn't seem to have enough plates/bowls for cake (if we'd known we would've brought some with us). Also would have been nice to be greeted and asked things like if we wanted plates out for food, collect music to Bluetooth etc - instead we kept having to ask for these things.","time":1676188031,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Ulya V","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106323312713287087036/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKJ4l8Dmd6cRPXKTqIlNwnBH1s-m3q9hd1ShpuRAxEZ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"Just wanted to say a huge thank you for hosting my little oneâ€™s birthday party at the Peckham cafe.\n\nAll the kids loved it, and it was really odd for me to be parent of the birthday boy and feel so relaxed! The staff were brilliant and the space to play excellent, not to mention the food which looked and tasted great. I was also very grateful for the catering to different dietary restrictions which was no trouble at all.\n\nWould highly recommend for a fun-packed party venue.

A lovely space with a great variety of food. Unfortunately, can often be quite crowded, which from a covid perspective can be a little uncomfortable. I also think that certain days are more suited to older toddlers because the babies and toddlers all play in the climbing area which can be a bit unsafe for under 1s. For parents with older toddlers you are often a little anxious that your child might fall on a baby! So I spent most of my time intercepting my son's freedom as he would dive into the ball pit ðŸ˜ƒ\n\nI did however receive a complimentary pass when I emailed the owner with my concerns, which was a lovely gesture and would recommend visiting on a Saturday if you have children aged 2.5 to 5years.","time":1647924409,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Felisbella Cakes","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116317200673336153383/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXDlkAAI1ALwxgCQYkH6ebcKN9RceIoybl5tjOr2B5BQO7F=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"Amazing location for children party.","time":1698521546,"translated":false}],"user_ratings_total":28,"website":"http://www.appletreelondon.com/"},"status":"OK","place_id":"ChIJ5d7aySQDdkgRyIun82QU6NM","categories":["play cafes"],"address":"134-136 Peckham Rye, London SE22 9QH, United Kingdom"}
