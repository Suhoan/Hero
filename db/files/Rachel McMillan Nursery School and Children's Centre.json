If you are looking for a place with great contact and communication with your child's teachers and school, this is not the place. They do not reply to emails or contacts, and it is chaos. There is no specific room for your child, so they will be in whatever room they want to be in during their stay. I find this to be a problem for my child, who has been kept in a comfortable, safe, private, and cotton nest for the past three years. How would she feel being left in a place for three hours a day where she will not be individually cared for and listened to?\n\nI am not saying that this nursery is bad. It definitely is not. However, it is not right for me because I value good communication and a close relationship with my child's teachers. I also like to know where my child will be at all times, so that I don't have to search for her when I come to pick her up.\n\nThis review is based on my own experience, and I am not saying that this nursery is bad or unsafe. It is simply not right for my family.","time":1695921008,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Anna Gordon-Walker","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107976896358970808572/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocK97gfvrbLPoR7BBRp__3JA_3AD05C0fz6oereIZfWK=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"10 months ago","text":"Rachel Mcmillan Nursery School is a real hidden gem, a rare state-funded nursery with an outdoor ethos, impressive history, a very large garden and fantastic staff. Our boys attended for 4 terms and had the best introduction to school life as I think is possible. They loved the free-range nature of it and spent most of their time outside, where there is so much to do and so much space for them to run around and explore.\n\nThe staff are dedicated to creating fun activities indoors and outdoors and at the end of our boys’ time, they produced an amazing book of everything they’d got up to and all the learning they had achieved. All the while, the boys thought they were just playing and having fun. The management and staff of Rachel McMillan are wonderful and really committed to making this a very special place. There is a very low staff turnover which shows just how much they enjoy working there. It really is an unusual and wonderful place and I would highly recommend sending your children there. Go along to an Open Day or contact the school for a tour. They run the core 15 hours or 30 hours and also have wraparound breakfast and after-school clubs so offer real flexibility for parents.","time":1674656098,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Mr Bell","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114740791619688990757/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVhZw9hS-oxo7nnPf7sdJKyAicEwp3i3kq-Cv9dMzFP_w=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"7 months ago","text":"A nursery that will certainly encourage positive sociological growth in children during the early learning stage; Rachel McMillan will strive to achieve this.Toddlers learn to share via selfless play and how to work productively in a group setting.

It has over 100 years of history of being different, with play at the heart of learning.\n\nThe well-deserved Ofsted Outstanding ratings come from the staff who truly personalise the experience for each child.\n\nEach morning starts differently with a smorgasbords of activities laid out. It says something when you are jealous of how your child’s day will be even if your own is looking good!\n\nOur child, like others, was supported in their first experience of being somewhere for them, without parents. Singing, dancing, drama, creativity, numeracy and general confident have all been gently and intentionally developed.\n\nThe space is focussed around outside space and shelters (classrooms orientated towards the outside) with encouragement to move and mingle between them.\n\nThere is a ton of outside space with more toys than could ever be used. Trees, a pond, forest school, little shop, unusual and typical play equipment, it’s just the variety you’d want to see. During the settling in period it’s lovely to see how the freedom of the kids as they get to use it all.\n\nBtw the current headteacher, Rachel Hogarth, is typically found at the gates greeting children by name. But don’t let the nursery name confuse you with the original founders, who I’m sure were equally lovely.\n\nThere are some historic photos from back then which feel similar to modern day and speak to how the nursery’s special ethos has been carefully nurtured through the years.\n\nAlthough we haven’t used it, there is a breakfast club and after-nursery support available for those who need it.\n\nPut another way, consider this nursery on your shortlist. The entrance might look like a wall with some quirky metal cat sculptures on-top, but really it’s a secret garden. Your child will love it, and so will you.","time":1658480185,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Zita Vasas","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115873745805476403394/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXjN55nVf6CsB4p0E0jrrpYT2kIiJS8tVp4favG-pxduLo=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"3 years ago","text":"This is a fantastic place!
