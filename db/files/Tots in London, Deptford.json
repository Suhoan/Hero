I love that the café seating is inside the play area so it’s easier to keep an eye on the kids. The role play stations themselves were a great hit. Seating was comfy and had little storage cubbies underneath which was a great idea to store things away without getting in kids way. Everything about it was child-friendly and very well thought out, even down to the toilet having a toddler sized seat, stool, and baby changing area with spare nappies etc too! The food was also delicious and halal which is a great bonus! Only improvement I can say is to potentially have a portable ramp/one built in just for easier buggy access into the café. The owners are also very lovely, helpful and welcoming. We’re very pleased with our visit and how local it is, been wanting something like this for a long time! Will be going again for sure!","time":1684415402,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Tamara Woodhouse","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100889051444186040318/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWvsYvIfHS8p6YnBTThL2knDY0N59rQHoGPuDyHqzVB5Q=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"I came this morning with my two children aged 3 and 18 months.

The staff did an exceptional job of making the day special, ensuring that everything ran smoothly.\n\nThe role-play area was a highlight, providing endless entertainment for the little ones and sparking their imaginations. It was incredible to see how much fun the children had while exploring various scenarios and interacting with the well-designed props.\n\nOverall, it was a blast for everyone, and I can't recommend this place enough for a memorable kids' birthday celebration.
