They make a point of telling you that at the gate, then at reception, then again from the class teacher. Guess what, life happens - you can't control external factors such as traffic, illness etc. However, their pedantic obsession with punctuality doesn't go the other way so they will leave you waiting at the gates and be late themselves opening it, but that's not an issue. Also, you will never see the headteacher - she sends are minions out to man the gates because she's far too busy drinking tea in the warmth of her office rather than welcoming parents and children. I think that says a lot about the leadership in itself.","time":1649109470,"translated":false},{"author_name":"bianka erdei","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106768788176634713953/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLkm_f9Z-sVdVpKqX22dExhNmzPuqsL52A9I7Jr81vY=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"3 weeks ago","text":"Poor responsibility from the stuff members…","time":1699394297,"translated":false}],"user_ratings_total":22,"website":"http://www.rowlandhill.haringey.sch.uk/"},"status":"OK","place_id":"ChIJS-VFOKwedkgRmnz4GtcCw7Y","address":"White Hart Ln, London N17 7LT, United Kingdom","categories":["forest school"]}
