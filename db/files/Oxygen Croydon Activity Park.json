The waivers which had been signed online couldn't be found on the system which meant we had to do them again which took forever. We were then sent to a party room and no one came to get us at the start time of the party which resulted in me having to find someone. By the time the kids were ready to go to the trampolines we were 15 minutes into the alloted party time. During the food time, no one came in to check on us once, they came and cleared the plates and we were promptly thrown out even though we had started late. Luckily the kids had a great time but rather stressful for the parents.","time":1698692734,"translated":false}],"user_ratings_total":1768,"website":"https://oxygenfreejumping.co.uk/activity-parks/croydon/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=seo&utm_campaign=gmb"},"status":"OK","place_id":"ChIJeeKfJV0HdkgR-C00vxoTpTI","address":"The Colonnades Purley Way, Croydon CR0 4RQ, United Kingdom","categories":["sports","soft play"]}
