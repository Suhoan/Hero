Was a spur of the moment plan and it worked out great. Sessions start on the hour every hour for 45mins.  Luckily we arrived at 11.45 so by the time we brought our tickets (everything is purchased online) and changed into my skates it was 12pm and we were good to go. The ice rink is a great size and has a central podium where you can skate to and from. They also have the safety penguins for the younger kids to use for balance and these can be purchased for use additionally.  They had free face painting for the kids happening as it's Halloween which was a nice treat and various Halloween decorations throughout. Overall a great experience. Only downside is  was on the pricy side. I paid £40 for x1 adult and x1 child so bare this in mind.","time":1698513149,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Jacqui O","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111940278157091843652/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX6FGfOiN4kqlmxVI8VhK4-ZiTH7FmWft4FHFBQ4aiKTdpb=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"in the last week","text":"Ice Rink Canary Wharf returns for 2023.

After a short while it’s boring. It needs to be a bigger circle and/or different shape (odd shape). The music is also boring bar few songs. And I went on a Saturday evening 8pm, a time I expected to be much more entertaining. Additionally unfortunately there isn’t a water fountain, not even a small bar to purchase soft drinks and snacks. Disappointed.\nThe really positive point is the rink overcrowded, so is it because the rink isn’t popular or is it because the number of skater is limited?\nA second positive and last point is the session is meant to last 45 min but we’re now over 1 hour and 15 minutes and there isn’t any sign that the session is closing. I’m taking a break and wait for my kids who have more energy than me after skating for that long.","time":1699132684,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Alice Forever","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102389757199755223997/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX0kyxUcFiAeZ6lBd6q7YMKT5ndau3V_6Q-hyTCox7joUY=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":2,"relative_time_description":"2 weeks ago","text":"Edit: Make sure you read the FAQ in the website thoroughly before booking.

You have to stow any bags, and they charge you a non refundable charge to put your stuff in lockers. Also skating aids are only available to children of a certain height, though they don’t actually measure your kids, and more eyeball it.
