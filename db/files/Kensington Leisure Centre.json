A nice welcoming experience with a snack at the cozy cafeteria where you're met with a warm smile! It's great for doing some work on one's laptop or studying,, or having a nice chat among each other, enjoying a nice hot drink and a piece of cake!, while it's still quiet enough to relax and concentrate on one's own affairs :) There is a large kid-super-friendly area  and plenty of tables to sit, making it ideal for families and their kids to enjoy a great time together! The centre is bustling with people, from all ages and walks of life! ;)  And the restrooms are nice and clean.

We had booked the basketball court for a solid 2 hours last week, ensuring everything was set for our game. To our surprise, we received an email this morning informing us that our booking had been cancelled. This caused immense inconvenience as our team had travelled all the way from central London specifically for this.\n\nUpon arrival, we were further frustrated to find out that we could only play for an hour. But what truly soured our experience was the attitude of the workers. Instead of being understanding and accommodating, they were extremely rude and insisted we leave immediately. Such behavior is unprofessional and unacceptable. I hope no one else has to go through such an unpleasant experience.\n\nRacist manager and worker, problem with their end but we are the ones to take it.","time":1697456261,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Chengwei Xia","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115421833004146256401/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJaioyFth3PQOk-mUY_7ozWIcWOjfIvX83X6l8Lx0gm=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"Such a bad experience since they just kicked us out due to an unfair cancellation.
