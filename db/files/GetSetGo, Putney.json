Our first lesson on 22.05.23 did not go ahead as their WiFi was down so the teacher did not know we were there and were booked in (no receptionist at this time) so we waited and waited and waited while my son (who was so excited) got more and more upset. This was resolved and the owner dealt with my son very well; once the lesson time was over and they realised the mistake. The owner gave him a free hat and goggles and told me the lesson would be refunded. My sons lessons commenced and he absolutely loved them. His teacher was brilliant and I cannot thank or praise him enough. I emailed the admin team in August asking if we could change our lesson time slot and asking when my refund for the missed lesson in May would be processed. They said it was processed on 18.08.23 and to allow 7 days for it to reach my account. 7 days later and nothing had arrived. I emailed them asking them to call me (as they only answer the phones 50% of the time) but they did not call me, instead they replied via email and said the accountant is on annual leave and will return on 31.08 and will process the refund then. They were defensive when they asked if I would like another teacher (our amazing teacher only had limited space so changing the time slot meant changing the teacher) as I pointed out that I had heard that other teacher they had recommended making jokes with a male student child saying \"if you were a girl you would listen.\" I explained that would not be a good fit for us as my son also has listening issues (as do most kids regardless of gender). They were using ChatGPT to reply to me and were defensive and said he had worked their for years. I explained that I pay for one on one lessons (Â£240 a month) because of my sons attention span (otherwise I would pay Â£20 a month for a group class at a leisure centre which is a lot closer to my home) and if the teacher is frustrated with the child then I don't expect them to make jokes. I expect them to interact with the child using well known techniques to get them to listen. We attended a lesson and I asked the receptionist about the refund and told her that I shouldn't have to chase this as it was becoming stressful. She explained that it is marked as urgent and would be refunded on 31.08it is now 11.09.23 and I still have not had my refund. I cancelled the direct debit as I cannot trust an establishment who steals from me and does not even communicate with me. They were quick to me email regarding the cancelled direct debit but cannot refund me my money from the missed lesson on 22.05.23. I have spoken to gym chains who also do one on one lessons. All of these chains have assured me that if a lesson was missed they would refund us straight away as they have financial teams in head office. Instead of one accountant who cannot process a refund four months after the missed lesson. An admin team who cannot call a parent back after this was requested in email. An admin team who is defensive when concerns about other teachers are raised instead of reassuring and supportive. An admin team who is not fit for purpose.","time":1695038861,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Andrew Beney","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117041505272395222573/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLvt1qedTk3X3iuhVy4TkL6rNPExRhbh8rowj5-nRvw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"Excellent team on the front desk and in the pool.
