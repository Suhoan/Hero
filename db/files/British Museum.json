We arrived mid morning and we were expecting to queue but we went in easily despite the security inspection. There is no cost so no awful queue like the Louvre. We were able to leave coats, bags and umbrellas at the cloakroom for a very reasonable price. This freed us up to enjoy the museum. It is huge! We got a free map then decided to buy the guidebook and study it before setting out. We went to the 3rd floor first and booked for lunch at the restaurant. We then did the 3rd floor which is vast before an EXCELLENT, late lunch. Then down to the ground floor galleries. Unfortunately, the Parthenon galleries were closed but there was so much to see that it really did not matter. Keep some energy: The gift shops and book shops were amazing but since we are travelling light, we had to resist.\nWe made a donation because this fantastic museum is still free.

This is one of the premier museums in the world and lives up to the reputation.   You can easily spend a full day open to close if you want to spend time really reading all of the exhibits.  4 hours is a minimum and that's even rushing some.  The history and variety is beyond amazing.   This should be a bucket list location for anyone who likes history.  It's beautifully laid out and easy to navigate (other than one weird level).","time":1699038061,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Allan Russo","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110473003767621309475/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXBIgz3KPbMa2pJnz3e0itpGnf7bYx6XzgI-vpBCDuQMpI=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"2 weeks ago","text":"Couldnâ€™t get into the natural history museum as it was sold out so we went here instead. Itâ€™s amazingly entertaining and informative. The exhibits are stunning but it is busy as can be. The mummy collection was surprisingly huge as were a number of other cultural exhibits. All in all Iâ€™d rate it 4 stars for the exhibits, they are amazing. Take off 1/2 a star due to the squash of numbers of people but then Iâ€™d give it another star for being free !

There are so many things to see here. I really wanted to see the Egyptian artifacts, and I wasn't disappointed. You could spend a good while in here reading information and seeing what they have on display. I found it very interesting and informative. They have a big, seated food hall. I planned to make a second trip to discover more about ancient Egypt, Ethiopia, and the Roman empire. There is also an opportunity to see different cultures on display(Mediterranean, Eastern Asia, Mexico, Africa).
