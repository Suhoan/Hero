It's a great pool for babies, toddlers and older children. My 3 year old had a good time although he didn't stay for long in the water because of the wind (it's handy to have a towel). The good thing is that there is playground next to it immediately with toilets so you are all sorted. I gave four stars as my son enjoyed both the pool and playground.
