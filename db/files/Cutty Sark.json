There's very little to see inside and due to the extremely low ceiling you will find most of the time you are looking at the floor to avoid injuring your head. On the deck there is a bit of a view over the river but again there's little to see (some of it was cordoned off too). You will pay silly money in the cafe outside and we just didn't see anything worth the asking price. The money is predominantly about preserving the ship of course but it still has to be entertaining.","time":1701253912,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Ramesh Kumar","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109379595122110996605/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVRqN2FAm013KPJkiC9eQDco44y436CVl8dyy1NChT-7X8=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"Worth your time.
