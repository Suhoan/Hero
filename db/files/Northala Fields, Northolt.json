I noticed there was plenty of ice cream vans in and around the area which made it nice for a hot day in the park. The hills were a fun little trail walk up to their peak and was family friendly.

One of the play areas is a standard colourful playground with all the normal items, the other is a wooden obstacle type playground with really good slides! It was very busy when we came but still enjoyable. Other things to do in the area include visiting the cafe, ice cream trucks, bringing items for a picnic, walking around the ponds, going fishing and walking up the hills themselves. Parking is paid and you can usually find a spot easily at one of their car parks.","time":1685064509,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Deborah T","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115615203073119093529/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLiFfNYNtf-yONwGF8BuDxpR05tvifdWzjZDyqGvGuf=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"4 months ago","text":"Great place to take the kids to expel some energy! Plenty of open space for picnics but not much space for parking. There were quite a few benches dotted around to rest while the children played. There is a small playground for younger children and at the other end of the park, a large wooden building for the older ones to clamber over, under, through, up and down! There are also a couple of small ponds/lakes where people were fishing (this appeared to be the only shaded areas) and another small boating lake. There's a small cafe and toilets near the wooden structure and lakes.","time":1691324199,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Umesh Jethwa","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117481088126437713708/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVrtvehjQrmMSQQ7m41B0iQAk3sioEyvFcny-PDbFeEtIc=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"5 months ago","text":"Fantastic large open space for all the family.\nHills with amazing views, adventure playground, fishing lakes, great for dogs.\nOften have a mini fun fair too.\nOnly downside was that the toilet facilities were closed.","time":1686651872,"translated":false}],"user_ratings_total":6311,"website":"https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201136/parks_in_the_borough/663/greenford_parks/2"},"status":"OK","place_id":"ChIJN3hATcsSdkgRPscumUj6FqU","categories":["playgrounds"],"address":"Westway Cl, Northolt UB5 6UR, United Kingdom"}
