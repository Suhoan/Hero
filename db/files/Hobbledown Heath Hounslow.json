Wheelchair friendly and facilitated for all users. I had a brilliant time today and the sun was out which made it even MORE enjoyable! We brought food into the venue and had picnics while the kids played and saw numerous animals on the farm. They LOVED feeding the goats üêê! There was outdoor play area and indoor play area! Everything was well spaced out and even the adults can play! I didn‚Äôt miss the chance to play on the slides A LOT OF FUN!!\n\nCar Park - ¬£1 per Hour. To be paid at the car park machine using card only\n\nToilet - plenty around the park clearly signed\n\nOn site food: average prices but certain things are a bit expensive in my opinion. Most people brought their own food.\n\nIndoor Play Area beautifully connected to 4/5 soft play areas. The kids were playing non stop for 5hrs!\n\nAnimals: we saw them all outside such as Goats, Macaws, Giant Rabbits, Lamas, Yak, Cow, Deer, various Prey Birds (beautiful) and managed to caught a prey display show.","time":1684602343,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Ellie Hyde","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103653096869216420864/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKemVQJGdQTbuECYZjyl_2Hm5FG7mzI6_RRfuXyk0Ya=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 weeks ago","text":"Really awesome day with the kids.
