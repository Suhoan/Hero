A must visit attraction when you are in London. Wax figures look very real. Visited on Sunday afternoon and it was not very crowded at that time. They have figures of famous celebrities , Royal family, star wars and marvels. Spend a good 2 hours inside the museum. There was a good ride inside which was also fabulous.
