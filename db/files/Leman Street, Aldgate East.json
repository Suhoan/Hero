Made a McDelivery order of over £50.00 for 4 people this afternoon via the McDonald's app. When the order arrived, half of the food was missing so one person did not have any food and another two of us only had part of our order. The fries were also only half full. When we phoned the restaurant directly to request the missing food to be resent all they did was give us the number for Uber Eats and refused to deal with it themselves. I explained that it is not our problem that they do not have drivers and they should be contacting Uber Eats themselves to send the food back out to us but they insisted on fobbing us off to Uber Eats. Uber Eats were useless when we called the number the restaurant gave. They refused to send the missing items to us and offered to refund only the missing items but would not refund the delivery fee for us to reorder the missing items after their service failed to deliver all of the items in the order thus breaking the contract. Why should we have to pay another delivery fee or go and collect the order in our current condition when they made the mistake? It seems this is a case of two companies working together, neither of which want to take responsibility for the problems caused leaving the customer to have to fight just to get what they paid for. We have now had to repay for the missing items to be sent and another delivery fee on top of that just so that everyone could have something to eat. We will be keeping the receipts and writing a complaint to head office of McDonald's and Uber Eats to have this rectified correctly. You wouldn't expect this with any other type of service so why should you expect it from a well known restaurant and food delivery chain who are well known for continually making mistakes like this and why are they still allowed to operate like this? Very frustrating and I would advise avoiding this branch of McDonald's and using the Uber Eats service unless you want to pay over £70.00 for an order including 2 delivery fees just to not receive even standard service! I will update this as things progress!","time":1675531380,"translated":false},{"author_name":"James Ballantyne","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101567394574285635413/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVa3c9pzLtcLP2V-UN8jNg1bKSXc8Td6dRQ0qo4haCx-dU=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"This is UBER's Head office. This is a review of UBER Eats - which does not seem to allow for Trust Pilot reviews anymore. They are all shocking btw. A petty (I suppose) complaint/review. Apologies. Ordered a delivery ( I am immobile for various reasons). Delivery receipt itemised a list of goods that had been paid for. One item missing despite having been paid for. Several painful phone calls later and I have been offered a credit which does not actually cover what it costs to get the missing item re-delivered. Dreadful service .
