We went on a Saturday afternoon. We booked a slot using the museum website; entry to the museum is free. I also purchased tickets for the Red Arrows 4D show (£16 for a family of 4, and the last show is at 3.30pm). The 4D show was worth it.. the staff here are super friendly and will happily spend time with you explaining the history behind the exhibit you're in.\n\nFor the museum itself, it's got multiple hangars housing various aircraft. H1 is the first building and houses a Red Arrow, F35 Lightning and so on.. H2 is more focused on early age aircraft. H3, H4 & H5 are the best ones.. housing the majority of the jet aircraft. Its a really good experience as the aircraft on display are in amazing condition, unlike those on the Intrepid in NYC where the cockpits have been painted over. That said, you get to actually peer into the cockpits of multiple aircraft, the F4 being my favourite. All in all this is an amazing day out with the family, allow yourself at least 2-3 hours to see everything. Parking is reasonable (£7-10) also, and you have to pay this before you leave H1. Simply put, I'd go back again.","time":1697917982,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Monika Varga","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100209674745833910055/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVcbRZsGI5ZPLb-7txdAI2-Qlj7Wgl68bub5oYX95WqGt8=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a week ago","text":"What a nice museum to visit with kids.

A nice mix of aircraft, bombs, missiles and other exhibits. Even though it was busy, there was more than enough space to maneuver around. Definitely worth a visit.\n\nIf there was 1 thing that could be better, it would be that there should be more interactive things for kids especially and some video showing the history of the items on show or showing them in service.

I highly recommend it, and my little ones love it. Free to visit, for peace of mind you can pre book tickets but not essential, but you do need to pay for parking. If it's your first time, give yourself a few hours. There is a cafe there and places to eat a pack lunch.
