I attended the Swim for Women here. The facilities are clean and tidy. Not too busy when I visited either. £1 is returnable for the lockers. Plenty of parking in a nice, open area. The staff were lovely but I'd advise for them to be a little more organised as I ended up waiting in a queue at reception just to sign in for my session when this could've been avoided. I'd also advise for the facility to employ a female lifeguard for the women's only session as having a male lifeguard defeats the purpose of the privacy of the women's only swim. I'm yet to try something from the cute, little cafe they have inside but overall, it was a good experience.","time":1689606475,"translated":false},{"author_name":"DOR Architects - Dor Cohen","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104227993224968690405/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXuAsJ-lxoMsBZJrXAnfeG9DV-zN_zcPlQfNckL_u8kuyY=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"I knew the old Copthall which was old and pretty awful but still provided important sport facilities.

My recent experience has been marred by the issuance of parking penalty charges for each visit to the facility, which I believe is an illegal practice. Furthermore, the lady at the reception desk responded to my concerns in a rude and unhelpful manner, claiming she was unable to assist me.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is unacceptable that as a paying member, I am being penalized with parking charges every time I use the leisure center's facilities. This seems like an unjust way to treat loyal customers and does not align with the terms of my membership. I expect fair and transparent policies that prioritize customer satisfaction and convenience.\n\nEqually disheartening was the unhelpful attitude displayed by the receptionist when I approached her to address the issue. Her response was not only dismissive but also delivered in a rude manner, leaving me feeling unheard and frustrated. As a member, I believe it is essential to be met with professionalism and respect, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nI urge the management of the leisure center to rectify these issues promptly. Firstly, parking penalties should not be imposed on members who are paying a considerable monthly fee. It is unfair and gives the impression that the center is more concerned with revenue generation than member satisfaction.\n\nSecondly, the reception staff should undergo additional training on customer service and conflict resolution. It is essential for them to handle customer concerns with empathy, understanding, and a willingness to find solutions. No member should be made to feel powerless or unheard when seeking assistance.\n\nI hope this review serves as a wake-up call to the leisure center management. As a paying member, I expect fair treatment, transparent policies, and respectful customer service. I sincerely hope that appropriate action is taken to rectify these issues promptly and improve the overall experience for all members.","time":1689068165,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Pawel Pisaniak","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107405443367634482146/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUH0VPzF_Hi2IdRSRwnM7hyVJZ3QZ_GtckDJamCjuhboF4=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"I only attended for one swimming session which cost £7.80.
