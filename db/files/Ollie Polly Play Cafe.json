Amy and her team were so attentive to our needs throughout the party. They were on hand to serve food and drinks to all of the guests. They checked in with us about all of the details on the day- when we wanted to cut the cake‚Ä¶ if we‚Äôd like a member of their team to hand out party bags etc. They looked after us so well. Also they decorated the cafe beautifully. We had a pastel rainbow theme and everything looked amazing. We received so many compliments from our guests about the venue and all of the kids thoroughly enjoyed playing with all of the toys. We hoped for a day that our daughter would enjoy and she really really did. I‚Äôd recommend Ollie Polly to anyone with a little one having a party. They went above and beyond. THANK YOU!
