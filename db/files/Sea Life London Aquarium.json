The diverse marine life on display is not only breathtaking but also educational. From the vibrant coral reefs to the graceful sea turtles, every exhibit is a feast for the eyes. The knowledgeable staff were passionate and eager to share their expertise, making the experience even more enriching. It's a fantastic place for families, couples, or anyone looking to escape into the enchanting world of the ocean. I left with a newfound appreciation for our planet's aquatic wonders.

Sea Life is\nnext to the London Eye. You can go to Shriekh Adventure & London Dungeon too so please keep track of your time when purchasing tickets as it takes one & half hours minimum time to visit these places.\nWhen you enter see life you get to see sharks moving underneath as it has a glass floor a great experience. A variety of shark tanks are there. Children love this place as it is crowded with kids. Inside restrooms are there too. The jellyfish tank changes colours it looks so beautiful üëå. Variety of live corals a treat for eyes. Another great attraction is the penguins they walk, they play around just making their video I felt so happy ‚ù§Ô∏è. You get snacks inside sea life too.\nTo reach sea life one can take an underground metro by crossing the  Westminster Bridge.
