In the off chance they hold a conversation, you still won't get any questions answered and will be told to expect a call back but alas, months and still waiting after multiple attempts to get anyone to answer simple questions.\n\nAvoid at all costs and instead utilise church street or seymors leisure centre which are run by the same everyone active group but are far better with their customer service.","time":1700258452,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Oo L","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107366872726562371821/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUSYSAUZ-LKrjsl4vxJzy8QI6TAFHgw6m89tcVUUkUB8A=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"Nice sports hall.

A hook took about 4-5 weeks to replace whilst one of the two triceps ropes is missing for 8 weeks. There’s only a single balance ball left in the stretching zone for about 6-8 weeks. The management is dysfunctional and lousy, whenever an equipment is out of service, there is a sign saying an engineer is called “today” with no date, as they’re the only clever bunch in the town! The staff usually hide in the back room behind or the Fitness Assessment Room on the gym floor. The most disappointing part yet is the lack of cleaning. I’m terrified to say that the gym floor and changing rooms are in a disgusting condition. The same used cotton piece with a blood stain is next to flies machine for 2 weeks! Leftovers of a bunch of grapes remained on the benches in the male changing room for 2 consecutive days and today (27 Dec) I’ve seen that under the very same bench. The paper towel dispensers are often empty. The toilets are not brilliant either, albeit there’s been a slight improvement since my initial feedback upon which the gym manager responded and promised to give me a call in May. I’m yet to receive that call, which I’m not really precious about. However, the toilets and changing rooms definitely have a ventilation and air conditioning problem. All in all, it is cheap and you feel it all the time! (Most photos taken on different dates.\nUpdate (Oct’19): Nothing except the cleaning seems to have improved. More dumbbells have gone missing shown in the new photo. The PT guy screams, shouts, sings with such a loud voice; management is non-existent. Such a shame for the great investment in these facilities.","time":1571853345,"translated":false},{"author_name":"James Henderson","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107487618820555484338/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV1sacqbZ_MIk8NiMRwf5BiIblXiySgLS0KLLowPiSidsYB=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"My sons had thir Corona Jabs hir they verey gd with them and toilets for immaculately clean","time":1654456561,"translated":false},{"author_name":"jojo H","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109228245158077772859/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVfc3cR5kozovpEFB9Y94MiDCvrynjEtc1c733-XndJnZM=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"7 months ago","text":"Good location,nice and helpful staff.","time":1682616819,"translated":false}],"user_ratings_total":229,"website":"https://www.everyoneactive.com/centre/little-venice-sports-centre/"},"status":"OK","place_id":"ChIJ5zf1La4adkgRfupaXHxdVWg","address":"10 Crompton St, London W2 1ND, United Kingdom","categories":["libraries"]}
