The reason being is that it's a very brief, albeit interesting insight on the storied history of the Bank of England that stretches right up to the modern day. It's fascinating to understand how the cycle of the world renowned Pound comes into being and also the many creative ways fraudsters try to dole out fake notes and even more fascinating is the video detailing how the notes go from concept to design to circulation right into the tax man's pocket. If you've got a spare half hour going and you're in the area, then give the place a whirl - it is free, after all.","time":1698810261,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Ninh Ly","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104459371079200637912/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWNRDsGfeKnj8soFAh46HY2yFbIWXQDvvF3bY3ZdnrCgXk=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"NICE FREE ATTRACTION IN LONDON!\n\nI was pleasantly surprised with the Bank of England Museum, it’s an interesting look at how the concept of money was formed and that most of what modern banking is (loans, interest, bank notes) were invented right here. You’ll get to learn all about money, how money is made, how counterfeiters forge bank notes and you can even lift a bar of real gold (an 11kg London Good Bar with an approximate value of £700,000). The fact that it’s free is a massive bonus.\n\nSo if you’re passing by and you have a spare 30 minutes, it’s definitely worth going inside!","time":1697977469,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Venetia Cattroll","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117323446711742293571/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVc7bdk0c2Ilm7L2fryvZW2AACHif-8tTswBSu0p6RJZ7HS=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 weeks ago","text":"Great exhibition about the Bank of England, it has all the old bank notes.

It was like being at a airport as we went through the security doors to check if we had any dangerous weapons! Haha! As if!\n\nAfterwards, you will be greeted by the receptionist and be given a map of the museum.\n\nIt was not very busy on the late afternoon but there were a group of school kids (that packed out an area we were in.)\n\nClean toilets but small.\n\nSmall and intimate museum I thought. We spent about an hour or so looking around.\n\nLots of information to read and a little screen to watch about its history.\n\nThere was a very very small gift shop area which was very expensive!
