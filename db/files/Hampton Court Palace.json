You can just use your contactless card/Apple Pay the whole way here.\n\nWe bought tickets online, although probably didn’t need to as there was no line on the Thursday late morning we got there. The staff recommended stopping in the gift shop for a free audio guide/tour. This was a wonderful suggestion and I would say is a necessity to really get the whole experience. There’s no set path to where you need to start first, but the audio guide sort of eludes to starting from the kitchens first, although that’s where we ended up finishing.\n\nEnjoy the history and take in the sights. We got there about noon and left around 3:00 including a stroll through all the gardens and maze. We’re not the type to take in every detail but we don’t breeze past things either.\n\nWorth the money and the trip.","time":1695500349,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Renato Santos","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117931366108034608837/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVb8X4KDDZDZy9eI_x_udV5KJADfIcrrKDnBB_pyRaiuuw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"Slightly out of the way from Central London (about 45 minutes ride from Waterloo), but it is well worth the trip.
