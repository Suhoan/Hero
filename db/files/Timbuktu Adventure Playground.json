All the staff are amazing,so welcoming,friendly and caring for each child's needs. Healthy lunches given and plenty to drink to keep them hydrated.

They absolutely love going there. It is one of the few activities they do which always gets a thumbs up. In the holidays they can go every day and I keep expecting them to say they want to do something different but they keep wanting to go every day!! Part of that is the exciting activities planned each day, like Easter egg hunting, slime making, go-kart making, the disco. There is a big outdoor play area, with sand and water play, swings, slide and climbing frames . It is absolutely fantastic for them to go there in the evening, where they get lots of exercise and social interaction, compared to sitting at home on their phones or watching telly. They would even rather go there than the park with me because their friends are there and there are more activities. The staff are absolutely lovely, caring people who I feel completely confident to trust my children's well being with.  I feel so lucky to have Timbuktu nearby as it provides everything children need for healthy physical, emotional, social  and even brain  development.    This is especially needed in today's environment of fear about letting children play outside by themselves with their friends. Here they can play with their friends in a safe and stimulating environment.
