the toys, that were quite clean and in very good condition. I was impressed with the toilets, in one of them you can find all you need to change your baby, changing mat, wipes, nappies and even a toilet seat for those who are potty trained like my daughter. Food was fine, could improve though and include more gluten free options, but can‚Äôt complain. I wish they open until a little later than 3:30 though specially in winter, other than that, loved it, great space to have a coffee whilst watching the kids play.

I visited today for the first time with my two young sons. I had heard about this place when I lived locally, but never got to visit. Today I was desperate for a coffee after attending an appointment close by so I thought I would pay a visit. Natasha, the owner, was personable and welcoming, almost like speaking with an old friend.  To my delight I had missed the ‚Äòmorning rush‚Äô so it was nice and quiet. Honestly, why are there not more establishments like this? My sons played away happily whilst I was able to sit and drink a coffee without being bothered once. It just wouldn‚Äôt have happened if I had gone to a standard coffee shop. In fact, I wouldn‚Äôt have bothered. The prices are no more than high street coffee chains and anyway, can you really put a price on drinking a cup of coffee in peace? Your business is a blessing!","time":1692820713,"translated":false},{"author_name":"David Ashley","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102664170928729576382/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX1rb29vMH606i8mxbzvb8H3G9lePIeo4tvShn_vlDI6w=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"3 months ago","text":"What a strange experience. I just ordered ‚Äòfruit skewers‚Äô for my 4 year old that cost ¬£3.50. I received 2.5 grapes and 3 small strawberries (see photo) I complained and was told that was the portion and it couldn‚Äôt be changed unless I emailed the manager. I think even The Ivy would struggle to charge 30p for half a grape, let alone a local business in Winchmore Hill serving food to children who's parents don‚Äôt want to be ripped off. If it wasn‚Äôt for the seemly embarrassed friendly waitress who was passing on the message from ‚Äòabove‚Äô I would have given even less stars. Myself and my friends who are all families in the area couldn‚Äôt believe the response.  Absolutely revolting behaviour to charge so much for such a small amount of food even with ‚Äòoverhead charges‚Äô it‚Äôs beyond me how these people think it‚Äôs acceptable and then ask to be emailed.
