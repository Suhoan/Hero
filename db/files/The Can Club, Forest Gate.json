They were super helpful with sorting arrangements in the run up to the day, finding out our son’s interests so they could make sure they had the best toys out for him and his friends, as well as giving us options on what they could provide. For the actual party they could not have done more - friendly, helpful, so entertaining with the children and engaging them in fun games, adapting to the typical British weather making outside harder to use.\nThanks so much to Laura and Laura for an excellent party!!
