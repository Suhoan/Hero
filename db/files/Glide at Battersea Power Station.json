It looks and feels so special, but go after 5pm when it’s dark and the lights are at their best.\n\nThere is an outdoor ice rink which is great fun, expensive but worth it for the experience, especially for young kids. The small attractions look pretty but expect to empty your purse or wallet as prices are high as one would expect.\n\nThe glass house bars are what makes this experience worth the trip. You can sit indoor or outside, with the venue and atmosphere magical. It’s a great place to go as a couple or with a group of friends.\n\nI have only given it four stars because I don’t think the attractions present value for money, but we will be going back.","time":1699725796,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Candypop Hire","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101394387772640015619/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKkRws04J3JD-79p8t0TFhiu7lIBKXhCd2Fx1jq2KTVfw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"3 weeks ago","text":"Visited on opening weekend and as expected it was busy but the staff were really helpful and got us our skates quickly and with a smile.

Also lots of food and drink options next to the rink make it an overall very enjoyable and worth going in 2023.
