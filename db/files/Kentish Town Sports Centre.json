People are very friendly and respectful and the staff polite and welcoming however I noticed that, they don't reinforce the swimming pool rules and if someone is complaining about other distrespectful costumers, they acknowledge it but don't act. This is the   reason I'm giving 4 starts and also for the changing room which is a bit dirty and doesn't seem very looked after. The showers are very spacious and comfortable but a bit rusty, this is something that could be improved.\nOverall it's a nice environment and I'm now a regular!","time":1697024654,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Olivia Olsen","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117963677115204625717/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJjGg60Ujg8sKI5lvFzlNxi1eePdqoE6b9VulfQvzUL=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":2,"relative_time_description":"6 months ago","text":"My recent experience at Kentish Town Better Gym was highly disappointing. During my visit on 30/05/2023, I encountered disruptive behaviour from another gym user and witnessed unprofessional conduct from the staff in handling my complaint. Despite my attempts to seek assistance, no staff member was available on the gym floor. When I finally spoke with the Assistant General Manager, Gordon, he displayed an aggressive attitude and showed a lack of professionalism. This entire experience has left me deeply upset and raised concerns about the gym's adherence to basic health and safety standards, as well as the competence and professionalism of the staff.","time":1685465342,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Mozzartini","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116818167536829051397/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocK8ZtudbQTQA9PRpeHKVazvTZ4F0YozCUj-KA03vDjN=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"Very beautiful and clean swimming pool.
