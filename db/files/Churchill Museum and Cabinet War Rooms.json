I visit it during my first time in London, but I had one full week, which was plenty of time.\n\nI'd strongly recommend booking in advance and arriving as early as you can.

Reserve about 1.5 hours if you want to have a good look, however if closing time is near, the friendliest museum staff I've ever encountered will quietly and very politely inform everyone individually, that you should move on if you want to see the war rooms as well (which we managed thanks to them). Note that the shop closes at the same time as the museum, so visit that first if you're late. Well recommended.","time":1699301353,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Phil Cook","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116795935587532627576/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXq4rdZLK_wmyZhEQUVjtaBlblcmgON--sAvys4DhCpqsg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"Incredibly poignant and detailed experience that's a must when visiting London. You could almost feel the spirit of the war effort as you walked through the place, which was largely untouched from when the war ended.

This is a must see in London for anyone that can appreciate the decisions that were made in this bunker that ultimately lead to our modern world.
