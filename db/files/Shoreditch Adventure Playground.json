There was some kind of police incident but the adults in charge were great at distracting the kids.

It allowed me to have one of my first ounces of independence. The staff, especially Michael and Antonio, are especially good role models and dedicate their own time to looking after the children that go there. It is a safe environment for kids, especially working class kids, to engage in activities. The community has benefited from this humble playground and no matter how much money they spend on Shoreditch park itself, this playground remains unbeatable in its authenticity.","time":1683464549,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Baka chan","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115683526842244696669/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX4KiudhqF1H7xkbXOmuYitoMr9bmQ50RDY8g2BdoUeTVA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"3 months ago","text":"Very fun and new things are built every once and while so it's worth checking out of you have a kid who's into adventures","time":1692472144,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Irie Nine","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103697491651425460367/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWXB-Gem_pRYsCE7AWghA-6xvtrW0a3UNYMnSSBkBvsUQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"4 years ago","text":"Maybe I came at the wrong time, but there was a teen girl walking around swearing and no staff told her off.
