Better yet- It is free to visit! When you arrive, on the right there is a small maze garden full of various fresh herbs and flowers-it smells amazing. There is also a lovely Cafe selling hot drinks and cakes (a couple vegan options available) with outdoor benches and it overlooks the Thames which is a lovely setting on a sunny day- still particularly lovely on a cloudy one too! There are accessible toilets and a baby changing area. The animals seem well looked after and the farm even take on young volunteers to help look after the animals!
