Yoga, language classes etc. are also on offer here with some other lottery funded workshops.\n\nIs a collection point for the local organic food initiative.\n\nAlso the venue for the monthly councillor surgery for the High Street ward.\n\nRooms on rent for parties, workshops etc. Slightly on the expensive side considering it is a community space and the limited space and condition of the venue.","time":1521110487,"translated":false}],"user_ratings_total":134,"website":"http://www.themille17.org/"},"status":"OK","place_id":"ChIJW_vvL8YddkgRi3ngXRsGA2s","address":"7-11 Coppermill Ln, London E17 7HA, United Kingdom","categories":["soft play"]}
