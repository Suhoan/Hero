I took a 1 year old, but it was great for mixed ages. Lots of different messy trays, water play, sand and play dough. They have set it up incredibly well and are prepared to with tubs for bathing children at the end.\nThe staff are lovely and well organised.\nIt’s not forced. The kids can explore what they like which I love.\nThere is buggy parking on the ground floor, but it’s minimal, so a fold up buggy or child carrier is probably a better idea.\nThey have space for eating, changing facilities, hooks for clothes and cubbies for shoes.\nI cannot recommend this space enough and commend them for setting up something that is lacking in London.\nCannot wait to go back.","time":1675432650,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Amal Nasser Hirji","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107387596757601565412/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKaZhCisrsRZ0NHq0R358ZqYMNE-J8waXkkiYVyfEf-=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"a week ago","text":"Good classes but really unfortunate and rude managers.
