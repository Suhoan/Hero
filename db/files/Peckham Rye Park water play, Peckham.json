This afternoon around 4.50 I  took the girl I look after there . She is 6 years old and autistic. When we got there I signed her in and then she started to get very aggitated and stressed and then I realised that it was because of the music. I was turning around and leaving the place with her but then because the male staff who was sitting there watching us, I had the  silly idea of saying to them that my child was autistic and she didn't like the music and then I asked if they really needed it on which the lady answer - yes, we need the music on yes. I felt so embarrassed and regretted every minute for having talked to them. I just took the girl and left. Maybe this lady thought that I was been pretentious and arrogant which wasn't the case at all. Some noises can be very difficult for an autistic child to deal with like music for example. I just wanted for the girl to have a good time. She loves to the zip wire  and swings.
