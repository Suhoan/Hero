Purchase your tickets online in advance. Otherwise,  stand in line to purchase and then queue again to enter. The Crown Jewels are magnificent and will be a 3rd queue to stand in. The rest of the site is a self paced tour. There are some really narrow and steep spiral staircases to climb if you wish to see the cell/jail where the traitors and the 2 princes were kept. The stairway up to the two princes is very narrow with a low ceiling, and you can not see to the top. If you are claustrophobic or prone to panic, then you should avoid this climb because you will have to crawl climb the stairs and you cannot go back down once you start since it is one way and people will be climbing behind you. The ravens are great to see, so don't miss them. There is a changing of the guard every 30 minutes at the crown jewel exhibit. There is no parking, so Uber, taxi, or we used Golden Tours hop on/off bus to get to all the major sites. Great place to take the kids. It's a little more challenging if you have limited mobility or handicap. Easy walk from here to the Tower Bridge, and a 15 min walk to Borough Market.","time":1700581012,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Anna Recksiek Conder","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102757665290864314968/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU7B23tMHhmZ7EDUPsTlkdngumc80QlE1xsDABsp6_RKoo=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"Visiting the Crown Jewels is so Amazing! Seeing them and the armory in the White Tower was my favorite parts of seeing the Amazing Tower of London. The historical significance of these landmarks is palpable, and the Crown Jewels, in particular, were breathtaking in their opulence. The White Tower's architecture and its role in English history were fascinating to explore. The popularity of the site meant large crowds, which occasionally made it hard to fully appreciate the exhibits. The limited availability of water and food was a drawback, and it's advisable to come prepared. Moreover, the queues for the restroom were quite long, which could be inconvenient.\nDespite these minor inconveniences, the visit was entirely worthwhile. The Tower of London offers a unique opportunity to step back in time and immerse oneself in centuries of British history. The informative guides and interactive displays added depth to the experience, making it educational as well as visually captivating. For anyone with an interest in history and royalty, a visit to the Tower of London is a must.","time":1696973030,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Rohit Patange","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103037615651260137251/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWg-JoE4v8I9fnE-2zzs4sMek0onfMIREj9XRvfZJ-AzTs=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"Amazing tourist attraction of this wonderful place,it is one of the most visited places nowadays since the Royal Jewels are guarded here. The Royal jewels are amazingly displayed, and the history of them is well explained all along the place. Big queue for the Crown Jewels once you got inside the Tower, but well worth the wait. I suggest everything try to come early in the morning around the 8:30 slot. It will not be crowded at that time. There are lots of things to see inside the tower. The Cafe inside is a great place to take relief. The exit is beside the Thames with awesome views of Tower Bridge.\nWe thought it will take 2-3 hours but we spend almost 5 hrs. The fortress is maintained properly. The audio guide helps you a lot when you are in. The Ammunition department is amazing.\nI will definitely come back to visit them again whenever possible.","time":1694191463,"translated":false},{"author_name":"kenneth giles","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116251932261570190689/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWJ2tg2B4CLYWGFhCK_Can8lW-SUgnfFN6VJNMGRLULggVw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 weeks ago","text":"A great day out.
