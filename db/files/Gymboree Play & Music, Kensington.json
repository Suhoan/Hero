After giving my notice of membership their system shows no record of my cancellation. I have to ask the receptionist three times to confirm my cancellation. They promised they’ll look into it each time and nothing happened. I resent my cancellation email and reminded the team. However they still take fees for the next month. I asked to be refunded and they agreed. However still no refund after a week. After leaving the review, I got a call from Gymboree saying that my refund has been processed. It could have been a good experience if they are more responsive at the beginning.","time":1675172955,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Melanie Glickman","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111322980881107242553/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVC8Ks_7nUsC8f-cT6Cy3eDZ_Flf8P4N4U0LYa3JfXMJhI=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 years ago","text":"I have loved Gymboree with both my kids.
