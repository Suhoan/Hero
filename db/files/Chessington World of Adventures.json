The waiting times are wrong and you’ll be waiting over an hour for each ride. There’s plenty of restaurants for meals that start at £12 for each standard meal, toilets scattered and picnic areas . Everything is signposted, but you can still get lost.\nThe rides are hosted by very young people, who are subjected to rudeness by parents trying to push in. In general, the zoo area doesn’t have many staff wondering at all to answer your questions. I saw just one. The animals looked well catered for - giraffes have plenty of space . I did question the lack of space in the  lion, sea lions, and gorilla enclosure, but I’m assuming there’s a reason for this. The sea lions were restricted in the small area to swim in, so they went in circles - not nice to view. I would recommend purchasing your tickets online in advance as they are much cheaper.\n\nI’d return, but not in the holidays. I paid for close tarmac parking, but it was full.\n\nGreat atmosphere for families and animal enthusiast. The place is general is clean.","time":1691867819,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Corinna Fielder-Davis","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109881365675423819376/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocI56SfFW_ooUw3qRPtQYMzY9iIpbePaUVBcPj3O2w1A=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"As a merlin pass holder, we are regulars at the park.
