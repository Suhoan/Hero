I didn't pay for her as its not a big soft play for her to have fun in so I said at the desk when I entered that she is 10 and they didn't charge me. I went to the toilet and when I come out I was approached by 2 members of staff telling me I need to pay for her as she's inside playing. I said I don't mind paying but i thought she was too big to play and she was only sitting watching her brother, they said yeah you have to pay so I did.\nI wouldn't of had an issue with this, but everything she done, she was told off. One member of staff kept hovering near her, telling her off for basically moving! 'Don't go on the bouncy hopper, your too big' 'get out of there it's for under 6's' (the only children in this area was my children and my friends children)  another parent actually stepped in and said but there's another child over 6 in there and they are only sitting supervising siblings. 'Don't move that, it belongs over there'\nWhen I arrived at 3.30, they was hoovering and considering it didn't close until 5.30, my 2 year old was scared of the hoover and they was getting close to him with it.\nI don't usually leave bad reviews but I spent over £25 for entry and 4 drinks for about an hour of play.\nMy daughter felt so uncomfortable in the end we left after an hour.\nI was planning on getting the children food there but after the first 10 mins I got the feel that my older daughter wasn't welcome so I won't be returning.\nI'm guessing that's why there was no one in there either.\nSuch shame that in a place like that, children aren't allowed to have fun.","time":1678128208,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Alessandra Vona","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116681935798014958805/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX8dTWruw6IX5YQ8GjcAh5ThZG6Bsbp0bSc-xllGJUaMA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"10 months ago","text":"Not really sure what to say.
