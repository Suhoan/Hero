There is a good selection of animas to see and some that you can feed. Plus a snack bar to grab snacks, drinks and hot food. There is also a play area outside of the zoo gates where the park is. My son had great fun.\nParking is limited, is pay and display and located in the bays to the right hand side and left hand side, just as you turn onto Skelton Road.

They charge for groups (over 10 people). They have guided visits too. Animals: Hens, ducks, geese, peacocks, two ponies, two cows, sheep, goats, alpacas, rabbits (a gigantic grey rabbit), guinea pigs. They usually have pigs, turkeys and donkeys but haven't seen them lately. There are picnic tables, a café, toilet facilities, places to sit and wait for the rain to go away. There's a park with playground right outside. Once we were lucky to come during feeding time and a lady was encouraging children to help feed the friendly goats and cows. Peacocks and chickens might  be wandering around.
