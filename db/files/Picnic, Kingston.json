Now returning with my 3 year old and 8 month old and the venue and props are looking very tired. The toys show signs of wear and soft furnishings are bobbly. There was a bobbly felt toy on the post box which I guess was supposed to resemble a package for a postman but looked more like a chewed dog toy. It's annoying that there is so little to interact with during role play. The kettle was missing the button to press, the toaster didn't pop up, the first aid kit only had a stethoscope, the weighing scales in the doctors didn't really work and the fire station was missing the phone. Most disappointingly, the supermarket doesn't have a scanner or a till so you can't pretend to scan or pay. I am able to do better role play with my son's till and toy food at home.\nI honestly won't be taking my 3 year old again as there was so little for him to actually engage with. We have been spoilt by visiting the Little Lancashire Village when we stay with family and the facilities, props and pricing is just 10x better. There is so much for him to do there and the toys seem to be updated regularly to increase the child's experience every time they return. Please invest some of your profits back into the venue to update and improve the play experience for the children.","time":1699488600,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Selina Kuczewski","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115757042730311300342/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLVAkLKh1-s4jinSMCUI9vZJnz0FgS9gs0vIUXI-gXy=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"5 months ago","text":"We had a 5th birthday party here and everything was brilliant.
