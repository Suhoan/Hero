Staff are always eager to be helpful and do not mind being harassed by my five year old:) The library is stocked with a fair amount of books and in the younger readers corner there are chairs and tables for smaller children to sit and do some colouring and reading, as well as a couple of armchairs for adults to use. They have computers but I've never used them so can't offer advice. They hold a lovely summer reading challenge program for children, with a different theme every year, and staff members put a lot of effort into making this a success. They also have free parking with a capacity for about 6 cars which is especially m invaluable if you visit by car between the hours of 10 and 12 as that is when the local CPZ operates. I would love to give it 5 stars but I don't feel that would be honest as the building is very dated and can do with some serious upgrading - for example there is no aircon and windows don't open wide so in the summer it can get quite stifling. Hopefully funds can be allocated for them to renovate, just like Clapton and Stoke Newington branches have.","time":1673247633,"translated":false}],"user_ratings_total":60,"website":"https://www.hackney.gov.uk/stamford-hill-library"},"status":"OK","place_id":"ChIJu7bWlGkcdkgRDGhy3FCDbmw","address":"Portland Ave, London N16 6SB, United Kingdom","categories":["libraries"]}
