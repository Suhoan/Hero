He has formed close bonds with his teachers who take great care of him, this has given him great confidence as he has developed under their wing.

They both thrived and loved it - the settling in was very easy as they both immediately felt comfortable and happy there.  The space, especially the garden is large, light and well organised.  I like the relaxed, free flow, creative element. The staff are always very friendly and helpful.  They have always been very accommodating over my constantly changing working hours so they make being a working mum much less stressful as they do what they can to help you out.  Both my kids and myself made some very close friends here. I recommend this place to everyone and will be sad when my youngest leaves next month.","time":1560975331,"translated":false},{"author_name":"GetReal London","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104456900940878482925/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVevlFjCsmh14_nhcBwbAU5DcOQZzNyjb23Cn2fAEmliA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"4 years ago","text":"Maples was so wonderful that I wished I could have attended myself! My daughter settled very quickly and absolutely blossomed here. The staff are all calm, engaged, thoughtful and inspiring. The approach is child-centred and deceptively simple- the children are learning bucket loads through play; the facilities are fantastic and the garden and outdoor play area provide a wonderful environment in which to explore, play and learn. Maples is the most inclusive, supportive and loving centre I have ever come across for my 3 children, we still talk about it all the time, although my daughter is now going into year 3!
