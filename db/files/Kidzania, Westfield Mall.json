They could be in the place of mum or dad by working as a policeman or fireman. They earn money as adults do and can realise how hard it is to earn money by working. At the end they “bought” toys in the store with the money they have earned.\n\nI recommend of course this place but be there at the opening if you want to do the maximum of games !","time":1699403079,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Poonam Jain","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108634500692272132670/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWif1yoMvA_YPheUdr9muCWPGASL4jmmm0j_3jK2SIeIx9K=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"3 months ago","text":"It's a nice place for kids of 5+yrs of age.

They had just 1/2 family activities like radiojockey and TV presenter one.
