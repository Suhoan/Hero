Them being outstanding is not limited to the ofsted. Every member of team is really are OUTSTANDING. They go above and beyond to help you with any challenge you or you little one faces. You know that they are there to help you. My two children has been attending there since they are 2 years old. Settling in process is one off. Every other nursery just expect your child be settled in two days or maybe 2 weeks and expect you to leave them crying knowing they will be ok within few minutes. Pembury house nursery ensure that you are there supporting your child until they are ready and happy even if it takes weeks or months. They ensure the child feels safe. The teachers are so experienced and lovely. Their garden and sources are so good and designed for your child to explore the nature and world freely. Learning happens through play, discovery and in interaction with others. They include parents in many activities. The only thing I wish would be changed is their opening times as it does not suits working parents. They are open 8.30-3pm at the moment\n\nSimone, Zurine, Maxine, Zamina, Sue, Ruth, Kelly, Sian, Rabia, Steph, Ciara, Becca, Antonette, Allison, Nes Kim, THANK YOU so much for everything.","time":1676037076,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Michael Ross","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110610326667615729124/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXmC7QP0sdnjros6_qtgRZjBlUOsZX5ZcafhFHIRJgr2Q=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 years ago","text":"My daughter went here from the age of 3 until she went to school and we had very little to complain about. Children are engaged as soon as they enter making drop offs easier and less teary. All the staff are welcoming and appear to enjoy their  work. The outdoor area has excellent activities focussed on nature and craft. A council run nursery that has unfortunately fell victim to reduced funding and as a consequence has now limited hours of care and is the only reason why we didn’t send our youngest child here. Highly recommended though for a completely different concept to child care to a business led mentality of some private nurseries in my experience.","time":1629035090,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Chika Ezeka","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113222395636001709750/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWlBe9rifh8hX-RPpmjIKhn6mzZYDPSNAsBhZ5zpgCyAOwa=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"Staff members are nice and generous with advice and guides.
