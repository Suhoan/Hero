Lots of ball pits, slides and a course around the park. Does seem to not be maintained well - in the year since opening it clearly has been used and needs new balls / balls to be put back into the ball pit areas. Many of these were broken in half and dangerous for younger ones to play with. The blasters on the edge of the ball pit are no longer secured and did fall off while we were there.\n\nStaff wasnâ€™t paying much attention to anything - often on their phones / donâ€™t seem to care much. Also if you have a timed slot, and your child just stays inside, they wonâ€™t kick them out or anything.\n\nOur kids really enjoy it, but itâ€™s a bit pricy for something thatâ€™s not well maintained or staffed well.","time":1693292463,"translated":false},{"author_name":"shruti varsani","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112704885628205375393/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLzhGFMmKEi9v8i956YUESSdwWfa-sNxUh8uvxMChV1=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a week ago","text":"Iâ€™m really glad to say our party was a total success! Everyone had a great time, my expectations were set correctly by the local team and we were well prepped for the party.  I would advise all prospective party holders to take the time to understand the conditions to ensure you know what happens on the day, order of events and timings. Cake cutting is allowed in the party room but the cake is not to be eaten, therefore I was prepared to put cake pieces into the party bags.\nIt's also useful to have an adult or two keeping an eye on the children in the inflatable park. Follow their safety advice and everyone should wear long sleeves to protect the skin.\n\nI would like to additionally mention my two party hosts at the time, Aneesah & Evie who were absolutely brilliant, they took control and anything wasnâ€™t too much trouble for them!","time":1701030098,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Vikash Gandhi","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110200970700329525889/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX1e-crwvflaUuWPqyadMmHyApakIXKjlGbrImGmLi6Xo0=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"4 months ago","text":"A very open and inviting space.

You have to sign a waiver upon booking and this is for a reason. It can get dangerous as some adults are falling over and there are kids doing somersaults. Best to go when it is quieter. There are party rooms and there are also lockers and cafes on 2 levels. There are a lot of staff which seems good as well. Not sure if they are trained first aiders though... would be good to know. My son had a lot of fun though as he is oblivious of the potential danger. I went following him around the play area for an hour.
