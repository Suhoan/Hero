It was truly amazing! The attention to detail and the thought that has gone into making this club what it is, is exceptional.\nAll the toys are sustainable and wooden - not a coloured moulded plastic toy in sight. There is so much to do there that your children would never get bored.\nWe went into the art room and did some painting and playing with some freshly made Plasticine. We tried the cookery room and made some chocolate covered satsumas. The music room was amazing and we sat with one of the play-buddies on the guitar singing nursery rhymes! Ava loved the virtual football room the soft play climbing room was so much fun and the role play area was full of toys to really open up their imaginations!\nAll the play-buddies were so lovely, kind and thoughtful to all the children and you can tell the children have genuine affection for them and they really make this place what it is.\nWe also had lunch in the restaurant where the menu was very kid friendly and very reasonably priced too.\nUnfortunately the pool was closed when we visited so i can't comment on that.\nWe all had such a lovely day and had so much fun!!
