From the moment I stepped into the theater, the atmosphere was electric, and the staff were friendly and welcoming, adding to the overall positive experience.\n\nThe seating in the grand circle offered a perfect vantage point to enjoy the performance. The view was impeccable, allowing me to fully immerse myself in the show without missing any of the action on stage.\n\nNot only was the performance captivating, but the food and drink options available were also exceptional. The theater's in-house catering service served delicious dishes and a wide selection of beverages, making the intermission an enjoyable part of the evening. The convenience of having such high-quality refreshments available without having to leave the theater enhanced the overall enjoyment of the show.\n\nThe decor and lighting created a cozy and elegant atmosphere that perfectly complemented the overall experience. It added a touch of class to the entire evening, making it feel like more than just a typical night out.","time":1690234081,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Ela Dany","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117767548421570647033/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocI03ys0bjPgFW9dullYi3aAwUYJ5pgs0IaD3OiHcC0A=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"3 months ago","text":"The Lyric Theatre is wonderful and very popular within the parents community and I am glad we live nearby and don't have to go too far with my little child to watch shows.\nRecently we were there for \"Tales from the acorn wood\"\nThey had played 4 books my daughter absolutely loves: \"Rabbit's nap\", Hide and seek pig\", \"Fox's socks\" and \"Postman bear\"\nThe show is around 55 minutes and is just fantastic.\nWe were for the matinée and we had lunch on the terrace after as the weather was nice.\nThe bar has plenty of healthy options for both of us.

The Frank Matcham designed auditorium is impressive and well maintained, (though its seats are, for today's audiences, cramped and uncomfortable). The contrast to the modern industrial aesthetic of the building wrapped around it provides for a sense of theatre as you enter. The staff were helpful and welcoming. The fact that the Lyric Hammersmith is a producing theatre also makes it worthy of support (as does the very affordable £10 my Stalls ticket cost me).\n\nI was here to see 'God Of Carnage', a Tony and Olivier Award winning play that I first saw during its original Broadway run in 2010. This very fine revival doesn't lose anything in comparison. Highly recommended.\n\nA quibble : The audience attending this production was told very clearly that its running time was 90 minutes without an interval and that if you left the auditorium, you would not be re-admitted. However, latecomers were admitted to the auditorium after the show had started. My viewing was interrupted 13 minutes in to the show by 3 latecomers who were shown noisily to their seats in front of me by a staff member.  Why exactly the Lyric Hammersmith theatre  makes a policy distinction between readmittance and admittance in connection with a production that ran without an interval is unclear. In each case, the same potential exists for the audience to have their theatre experience spoilt by others.","time":1693739414,"translated":false}],"user_ratings_total":1331,"website":"http://www.lyric.co.uk/"},"status":"OK","place_id":"ChIJV5PlRm0OdkgRuQ-xXZHVTSk","categories":["theatre","winter holidays"],"address":"Lyric Square, King St, London W6 0QL, United Kingdom"}
