Located in Ravenscroft Park, there are two play sections. The smaller one is for toddlers/younger children. I find it quite small and there aren't too many activities. Compared to Clissold Park or Warren Fields, it's very small for toddlers.\n\nThe larger play area for older kids is AWESOME. There is a GIANT slide that I went down and it was scary and exciting. It's definitely for older kids as there are quite questionable gaps in one of its bridge and other climbing structures, which are quite high. I didnt feel secure even being there with my adventurous toddler.\n\nDefinitely lovely place to go if you are by Columbia Road.\n\nNice green areas surrounding the park for picnicking.","time":1652089499,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Muhammad anwar HUSSAIN","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116982483678168839892/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJG1nQbsj6Ztb7elXV8ivzhG2_SFHlNjDlki7-1MTR4OiQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"6 months ago","text":"Excellent quality environment for children.","time":1684695937,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Sam van Rood","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114551837035354612866/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXWw35u7L2vkZPNiz2-jOqzl7_LxB4weFyoHZ4DncIqpYU=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"5 months ago","text":"A fantastic well-equipped playground nestled closed to  facilities for parents like pubs Cafes et cetera","time":1686644627,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Wayne Adams","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114189110569255610738/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVfUcTcyKauiYndM9jgCciGl43zdeBWw1YprP_pqHsO8B4=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2","rating":3,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"Loving the refurbishment but unfortunately you still have this park in an area with high drug usage and this can be an issue but thankfully they only happen to pass through now and then and don't interact with anyone.","time":1662128704,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Nickij71 Robo","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113372628059704085413/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXDI_64JAq3oJG_IwHXBZD2wokQpFinbwJ4kzCdbtD0wYaR=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":3,"relative_time_description":"2 years ago","text":"The park has a great community feel.
