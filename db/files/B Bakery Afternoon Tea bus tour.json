The only seats left were table 7 which is the VIP table at the front left. If there are just two of you, and you don't pay the extra for one of the VIP tables, you'll have to share with others.\n\nThe bus was decorated so nicely, very festive and even green furry seats. The food was tasty and filling. I was worried my nephew might not like it as he can be fussy but he loved the cucumber sandwiches and the cakes. If there are any you can't finish, you can get a takeaway box. There are also unlimited hot and cold drinks.\n\nThe bus journey took 90 minutes and you get to see some of the big sights of London. There's no toilet on board so go just before the bus leaves. There are toilets at Victoria Coach station, quite close to the departure gate so use those.\n\nEach bus has a lead who asks about the Grinch, talks about the sights of London and a little bit of history.\n\nYou get to keep your reusable cup which I was really happy about as I love the Grinch!","time":1700427159,"translated":false},{"author_name":"David","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108292241814492528173/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVvQ1FBLU5mdrXwQjeCxjqlLll_BbGCY7OTaXAJA2HM4Jjm=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"Lovely tea and cake shop.  They also serve sandwiches and cream teas.  It isn't cheap, but there are no words to describe how good the food is, particularly the shiny ('Darling') chocolate mousse, photo attached, with macaroon on top.  Simply amazing!  The tea tastes fresh, quality too, and the plates, cups and cutlery are like an old fashioned village tea shop.  Highly recommended, but book early as it's very popular.","time":1696694326,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Trish P","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110487093146877043064/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKqcNdjsy44U4W3u0jikWpMdPt5faNUSJ0zn2bHbRsT=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"This is a great spot for Afternoon Tea in London. Great tea selections, food was excellent and the staff was very warm and welcoming. I wish I would have taken a picture of the scones and toppings (the second platter that came out), but I was super jet lagged. The place is bigger than it looks, as it also has tables downstairs. If you’re looking for a small, intimate place, I would recommend Brigit’s. If you want a big, upscale, suit and tie fancy place, this isn’t for you. It would be a great place for a bridal or baby shower, birthday or Mother’s Day.
