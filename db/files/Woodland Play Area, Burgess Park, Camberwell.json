With conditions that are nothing short of excellent, the playground truly stands as a testament to well-thought-out design and planning. Nestled amidst mature trees, the area provides ample shade, adding to its inviting atmosphere.\n\nThe adventurous spirit is catered to with challenging climbing frames suitable for both older and younger children. All play items are constructed from wood, which not only complements the natural surroundings but also lends a rustic charm to the playground. The soft surface underfoot ensures that any accidental tumbles are less likely to result in injury.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that the abundance of trees does bring with it a small health hazard in the form of bird droppings. Parents and guardians should be vigilant in this regard to ensure children's safety and hygiene.\n\nSurprisingly, this playground is not marked on the Burgess Park Information Display Board and Map. It appears as though it may have been added later on, and unfortunately, the maps have not been updated to reflect this. This oversight is quite disappointing, as it means many visitors could potentially miss out on this hidden gem.\n\nAll in all, the Burgess Park Woodland Playground offers an excellent balance of adventure, challenge, and natural beauty, making it a must-visit for families seeking an outdoor escape.","time":1697544771,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Erica Mcqueen","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108580073947071463217/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJ8xIZbiiFLjufcx0FhsgR5NMIqvdoqqQQmvAUfwlOL-w=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"6 months ago","text":"Nice park, plenty seats while you watch your children play.","time":1685781342,"translated":false},{"author_name":"ANTHONIA IKHENOBA","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105197032314066046966/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUCi9p5ZXeN2IJ8Qq_-Z15ODfMFmrO_HZkYB_whyrnQc6s1=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"I stopped by with my kids after dropping one of my kid at activity at a nearby place.\nI decided to hang around with my others at the place to play and have fun.\nMy kids enjoyed themselves in th park, lot of children were there having fun too.\nThey made friends.\nClean environment too.\nIt was nice out there.","time":1651499865,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Edita Nemethova","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106710308362585003853/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXmokyv4ofa09cILSwQk5gwhvTbE4AVJvcdGWIDYkaS8cKj=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"Great park, perfect for any activities.\nGreat kids playing area.
