Set back off the main road, you'll in for a surprise as the museum just keeps on going...and going..Turn another corner and there are yet more fun things to see.\n\nFavourite part was just comparing rooms from hundreds of years ago to pretty much today. The contemporary loft apartment is worlds away from the living room of the 17th century of course, but it's a joy to spend time just exploring it.\n\nA great cafe, beautiful gardens to explore. Free lockers, fun little colourful bookshop and staffed by friendly folks.\n\nAnd it's all FREE!!

The displays were lovely, though they were often more arranged by the “vibe” than time period/class of the objects. There are many interesting stories to hear, whether about the Victorian servant girls or people living in London currently. The museum is deeply humanising and invites to reflect on what might be dear to us and others. As such the museum is more focused on exercising empathy than teaching in detail about the technologies and fashions within domestic sphere, which is fine I guess. There was enough educational content to leave me satisfied, though if you look more for history of furniture I would suggest going to V&A.\n\nThe staff was lovely, they didn’t throw me out even though it was 17:02 when I was finishing my visit. I wish I could stay longer! Even the museum shop was nice and comforting.\n\nThe History of the Garden was a surprise and welcome inclusion! I love the current exhibition about witches, women in medicine and herbs. Good stuff.","time":1692825660,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Costa","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116885272788736190887/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWHD2ISYKkRJRyMgj9wvv7-YEnYbTLRWz8WADjO0Ab_ELs=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"One of the most well-curated and uplifting museums I have visited in recent memory.
