We marched around quite a bit of it, up Parliament Hill, around several lagoons, dams and swimming areas, near a pergola with live musicians, and through the wooded areas.\n\nViews from Parliament Hill were great, you can see a huge swathe of the city. Was good to get up a hill and look around as London in general is quite flat.\n\nBeneath the trees was great. There are plenty of walking paths. If you go off the main walkways and navigate the stinging nettles on some of the less-travelled paths you can be alone for quite a while. We even stopped at a bench in a clear area and sat for a while and didn't see another person. Was great to get away from other people and the general noise of the city for a while.\n\nPlace overall is huge, loads of things to look at and enjoy. We will definitely return for more and longer walks.","time":1689103327,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Alex Walters","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112372671802286516412/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW36dw_TRxg9GiCIG-G3H6e7gMKvUFFGDGqziD7bFwzKQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"One of my favourite parks in London.
