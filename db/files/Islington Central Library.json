People seat very close to each other.\n\nAt some point, there will be groups of young people standing, talking and laughing there for hours. They will completely ignore other people silently studying there. They will completely ignore other people's eyes on them. Why these people waste their life in a library instead of better wasting somewhere else?

Have been able to use the computers for free and to print off black/white & colour documents at a reasonable fee. You do need your library card, so will have to register if you do not have one.\n\nThe computers are located on all three floors, though the first floor one is for children. Unless you go quite early in the morning, there can be a wait to get on the computers as they are very popular. However at quieter times, you can extend the one hour time slot by making a request at the front desk. Have to say that the keyboards look like they are in desperate need of a good clean.\n\nFree WiFi too but have not tried it.\n\nThere are some friendly and helpful members of staff.","time":1565093704,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Peter Dyer","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109508278767207842085/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVHc6grJnjwswT1HCAEWDvuQtBok2GatB8YiO1Rsw8xdwY=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"3 months ago","text":"There's a really nice reference library / study room on the top floor with power points.
