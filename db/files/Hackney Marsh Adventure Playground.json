The adventure playground team led by Angela work very hard to always reinvent the playground and bring in new activities, different play frames.\nHere children can play freely, use under supervision tools like hammers, saws to build things. They learn to use their creativity. Honestly it's quite impressive. This is definitely an essential play area in the neighborhood.\nIt's ails to children from 6-15 who can stay there when registered with and without their parents/guardians. But it is also open to younger children if they are supervised by their parents.\nIt usually runs after school 3.30 to 7.00pm during week days, it's open on Saturday anf close Sunday and Monday.\nPs: Neville is a star, extraordinary gifted with children.","time":1554334457,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Jusbeer Kaur","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115375142830799076601/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocK0IYowpRYtrk2riikrzGTzWIqWfPlDi3shB3GSIGUI=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"3 years ago","text":"Had a Amazing time at the Christmas party.
