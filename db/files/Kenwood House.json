You only have to pay the parking charges. If you are an English heritage member parking is free with a car sticker.\nInteresting history about the previous owners of the house and how it has changed over the years.\nThe Library looks impressive, nice to see they had many books in their time.\nThe outside gardens are great for walking especially if you have a dog. There are several walking paths and one route takes you to the Dairy. It is closed but you can walk around the building.\nThe cafe is nice, there is usually a queue but the service is good and normally serve customers quickly. There is a good choice cakes and light meals such as salads. We went on a Sunday so there was a full Roast dinner with a choice of meat. Not sure if that was a Sunday special or if there serve it everyday. You can check the website for more info. Plenty of seating inside, but there is more covered outdoor seating as well.\nThey have a shop and a garden shop for essentials and a selection of plants and tools.\nSome good spots for a picnic if you want to sit and relax outside when the weather is good.","time":1693305398,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Karen Ballantine","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110864058220042793378/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWejkgzo1sPdS48k2rz1viBBn7b3dJo1poCc-1fAjbb7A=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"3 months ago","text":"Beautiful building with amazing grounds.  Friendly staff inside the house all very knowledgeable.  If you love art you will enjoy wandering through the circular walk through parts of the building.  Beautiful views from the back of the mansion down towards the lake and onto Hampstead Heath.  Nice restaurant and coffee shop for meals, snacks, drinks and ice creams.  Friendly staff, with patience of saints when dealing with some of the customers that I observed!!! Busy place so you would need to find a quiet corner after a walk.  Great place for families with kids who like the out doors and picnics!","time":1692808824,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Mio","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112360836607336623829/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJs5cnNgXGWMMA7oQyd63SrrarsUX0V_SvK0F-L9CEU=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"I visited there to see Vermeer's painting.
