Very popular with families, groups of friends having picnics in the summer and kids birthdays.\n\nGreat playground facilities, toilets, playing field, often used by the local schools. In between two railway lines. Often used as cut through in day time to Barnes Station.\n\nMany dog walkers through the day. In the summer the council fill up the small paddling pool, very popular.
