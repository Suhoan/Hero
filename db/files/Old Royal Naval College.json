and TV shows that use the site as a location. Its versatile beauty and timeless appeal make it appropriate for modern and historic representations alike.  I visited while the painted hall was covered with scaffolding during restoration. Fortunately, I had the opportunity to tour the conservation and see the ceiling up close. It was astounding. I look forward to my next visit so that I can see it from the floor, as intended.","time":1697043304,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Ela Tatiana e.t. photography","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106781691200953475635/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX3GFKFqBawGiG4B2uV_CrvHLR_3Z0N4294PtnhdJEqP7U=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"A few weeks ago, I had the pleasure of photographing a wedding at The Painted Hall. As soon as I walk in, I couldn't help but be taken in by the beautiful hand-painted walls and ceilings, along with the large windows that let in so much light. It's like stepping into a grand royal ballroom. It's a dream come true for anyone who's ever wanted a fairytale wedding venue.\nI want to give a big shoutout to Peter, the toastmaster, for ensuring everything went off without a hitch. He made sure the day ran smoothly. I also want to thank Lizzie for her work behind the scenes and for coordinating the entire wedding. Both of them were easy to work with and extremely helpful.\nAs the wedding photographer, I was truly blown away by the numerous beautiful settings available for capturing memorable moments. There was so much beauty to capture that it was almost impossible to use them all in just one shoot.","time":1698310520,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Jeanu Thomas","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109961333118931440153/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVIfTM6pI3J_-ud26J4cNv6b7OD6j31W6BNVH9lw_Pc-eo=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"5 months ago","text":"This is indeed the sistine chapel of London.

We visited the Chapel where they hold the graduation ceremonies and then walked down the spiral staircase and underneath to have  a tour of the painted hall.
