They are either friendly and nice or cold and uninterested.\n\nHad a latte whilst the kids played and that was ok. Similar price as chain cafes.\n\nSoftplay itself is adequate but some of the parts aren't fully locked in and another kid was stuck as they managed to push some of the pads up that you could climb on.\n\nNot sure if this is common but the customers that come here are mostly rude and obnoxious entitled people. As mentioned above about the stuck kid, the mum was just saying get out making no effort despite the child's panice plea for help. I went in and fished him out and fixed the loose padding. The mum gave me a dirty look and took their child away.","time":1699729419,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Agnieszka Gronska","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105986534685191497774/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIXyXdF9W0BoZhGst-6eJ3N0EpcL1Fwlp2woY51GXBK=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"Overpriced for value, board with nails hanging, broken toys on the wall, mats poorly fitted and moving around, fence with sharp elements.

We absolutely loved it!\n\nThe centre was the perfect size, with a good max amount of children in at one time. It was extremely clean and ideal for my son to play in.\n\nAdditionally, the lady (possibly called Stacey) who worked there was very friendly, polite and professional. She was welcoming and very attentive, even when they got busy.\n\nWe will definitely return. Lovely to see a place that is concerned with the experience being clean and enjoyable, rather than just making loads of money and allowing loads of children in to pack out the place.
