Free entry and only a small fee for The Butterfly House and Aquarium, both of which were great! The different museums are very interesting and lots to see. A great place to go as a couple or family and I will definitely be going back. They also do different events throughout the year which I will be trying out a few of them.

This museum has a wonderful animal, cultural, and musical exhibit as well as a Cafe, animals nearby, and a market with hot Savory foods.

My favourite exhibition was the aquarium. It was just awesome to get close up to see the many different colourful fish, frogs, sponges and corals. It was amazing! There are several areas around the museum to look at from natural history to world history; so fascinating. To top it all off, there is a wonderful spread of gardens outside with an animal area and the most beautiful array of flowers and plants from around the world and throughout history. It is such a unique and gorgeous place. Although we didn't take any children, it is a super child friendly place.
