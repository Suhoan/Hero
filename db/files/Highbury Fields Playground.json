The younger section has a big sand out, infant/toddler swings, small slides, etc. The older kids section has a truly impressive, very tall, straight slide. Also a variety of climbing apparatus, older-kid swings, zip line. There Are toilets and playground attendants. There’s also a small water feature area.
