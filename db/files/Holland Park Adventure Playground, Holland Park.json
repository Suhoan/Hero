My three (4, 9 and 11) all found something for them and were having non-stop fun.\n\nYou can tell how much thought has gone into it, from the little (arguably pointless) buggy/scooter bridge over the drain channel to the rotating thing on the downspout which would only work in the rain.\n\nThe wooden structures were made by someone who clearly listened to kids and thought ‘no, a bridge between a slide and a climbing thing isn’t good enough’. Cue holes, interesting ways to ascend, platforms on angles, holes to climb in, challenging slides, and more.\n\nThe zip line is beautiful between two redwood trees, but with ample space. The two swinging ropes over a dip are a fun addition - though smaller kids might struggle to get down to them from the entrance. And the long hanging swinging rope is surprisingly stable.\n\nDespite being a playground with safe/squishy landing areas, it feels like it’s in the middle of a wildlife meadow. In many cases this is beautiful, taking a leaf from Greenwich park’s playground, but it also has the same pitfall that it’s easy to lose shorter kids. Maybe time for a sensitive trim?\n\nSpeaking of which, due to excitement, you’ll likely miss the eco space on the right as you come in, give it a moment to pause to see big hotels, a wildlife space and more.\n\nUnsurprisingly to any parent who has been to a park with a ‘water feature’, they don’t work / have been turned off for winter / etc. Expect the usual disappointment but this isn’t a big deal as the rest of the park is so much more interesting!\n\nThere are toilets, one accessible and one regular (someone seems to have scratched off the ‘women’ symbol), though neither of them had any soap. The rest of park is also accessible through ramps.","time":1664814653,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Jessica Tardieu","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105124704763314625043/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVaUHsaDKctE1z7J0abDekfEIFjXpRCvua3yk_cNpLQpBG8=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"3 months ago","text":"Great playground!
