There are some rides inside a dark tunnel with all screams üò≥. The staff there were very friendly. It took 2 hours but fully entertained.\nThe ladies' room inside the London Dungeon is a must-visit üòÇüëç.

Don't just mute your phone & watch, turn them off it will help with the experience for all involved. Actors were good & decent dramatization of telling London's macabre history. A few jump scares but not overly haunted house style. We mostly had smiles from the great performances by the actors. They bring the audience into the act. My spouse got picked on a few times which he enjoyed & added to our experience. Some good extras that reminded me of 90's Universal Studios theatrics. One star because 1 feature was not open & another showcase the actor didn't perform. Photo packages are available at the end. Use the bathroom before you begin the tour as there are none till you exit. Overall I'd recommend this attraction.","time":1699222481,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Fae Moon","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102927524220105777908/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXaSIDTD87mhoRjWgODTh4aOqBoXL_RtESsKQ5S5_OAz_a_=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"I loved it so much doesn't even begin to describe it here.

If you like creepy gruesome experiences then look no further. The boat ride gave me chills and the seared drop ride almost gave me a heart attach üòÇ\n\nI have to say that each and every person in there was in character which made the experience so amazing. They were all great but my favorite was the girl who made the pies. Her acting was out of this world. Her creepy laugh made me wanna piss my pants laughing.  Also the judge was amazing as well so hilarious.  The acting of the witch was so spooky. It was like being in the exorcist movie. I loved every second of it.\n\nSorry for taking a pic of my partner when he got picked to be a volunteer.
