Worse experience I’ve had in a gym in my life and I’ve worked in gyms for 15 years.

These lifeguards have a zero-tolerance policy for common courtesy. I attempted to seek their assistance once, and their response was colder than the water they were supposedly guarding. Don't expect much assistance or a smile, as their customer service skills could definitely use some improvement.\n\nNow, let's talk about the pool's aesthetic appeal. If you're into swimming alongside an exciting array of floating objects, this place is a paradise for you! And let's not forget about the lovely assortment of floating debris that graced the pool's surface. I've seen cleaner water in a muddy puddle after a heavy rainstorm.\n\nIf you're in the mood for a freezing swim in a pool that doubles as a biohazard zone, while being serenaded by lifeguards who've mastered the art of nonchalance, then this leisure center is the place for you. But if you value your hygiene, your comfort, and your sanity, I suggest you run as fast as you can in the opposite direction.","time":1687808368,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Emma Mac","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110170646196910733472/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVeTOCanR9TV6xxIgp2CRkerDg6bNgpj-3XATw3Y_nzrAM=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"4 months ago","text":"Disgusting!
