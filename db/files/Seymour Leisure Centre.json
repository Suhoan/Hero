and grand. It rarely gets busy. Sadly it desperately needs more deep cleaning and better maintenance. The padding on many machines is torn and the floor bulgers dangerously in the first-floor gym.\n\nThere are plenty of machines, although some of them are broken. Some seem to get fixed fairly quickly whilst others are out of use for weeks or months.\n\nThe changing rooms are broadly clean and well maintained. My locker was recently broken into, all cash taken from my wallet and my cards were used fraudulently – the staff could not have cared less. There are plenty of showers and they work well, which isn’t a given in Everyone Active leisure centres.\n\nThe opening times are convenient.","time":1692709066,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Imran Akram","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113043677399390091150/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVS9fil0gAaISWKLmB_QDTQuYnyne6wZ12HB0sAC4xNGXsb=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"5 months ago","text":"My children take swimming lessons here, but we always end up coming along too, and swimming as well.
