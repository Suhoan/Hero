one round each on the pony one at a time with two people assisting them.\n\nIt's a nice experience to have despite my son only being 3 years old but he really did enjoy it as it was his first time.\n\nThe farm overall has lots on and organise events and activities for all ages/stages often.\n\nTheir website always has the full information and updates regarding the dates and times and costs which are usually not too deer.\n\nThey have a small cafe and gift shop on site which also sells animal food £1 a bag which is also enjoyable for the children as well as the adults.\nWe fed the goats today but the only sad point was that there were no pigs or llamas today.\n\nThere is also a playground on site and picnic benches.\n\nWe also took part in the meet in greet with a few of the smaller animals which is also one of my favourites.\n\nTickets to the farm are free but must be booked in advance.\n\nThe dates and times are online but the farm does run on donations so £5 a visit at least does help towards them improving things and taking care of the animals.\n\nMake sure to check it out if you pass or are local.","time":1693567130,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Princess

It's free but they rely on donations to pay for the upkeep of the animals so please donate what you can afford. There's a shop where you can buy toys and gifts, you can also buy a bag of animal feed so the children can feed the sheep, goats and cows (not any of the other animals!), there's a playground and horse riding school too so there's so much to do.

You will be very disappointed. Wasted money and ruined mood. £350 to stroke few animals for 10-15mins (it normally costs £2.50 per child) and feed the animals (the price of one bag is £1). We did not have enough bags, I had to leave the kids, run around the farm, looking for the responsible person. In terms of food... There were horrible looking sandwiches, carrot & cucumber sticks, few piecies of something looking like brownie.  Children were given little bottles of \"Fruit shoots\". That's all. There was no water. Thanks God I had some snacks to put on the table otherwise it would have looked empty.","time":1694537329,"translated":false},{"author_name":"dawn bowling","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113006272133383461349/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU13ZxiHuzbB-Xf4nxyoD4_W31mb4OZXUXnv4toodn8MUfX=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"7 months ago","text":"I first visited here with my godchild about 15 years ago and it was so nice to revisit and it hasn't changed. I think it is  run very well, I love that you can buy pellets to feed the cows, sheep and goats. The coffee shop has an extensive menu, the gift shop is very cute and plenty of benches to sit. I did read the negative review regarding the cow pen and would be interested to know if the cows go into the fields at night to graze?. It is like a little oasis behind the busy streets. Will happily return now I have rediscovered this hidden gem.","time":1683030412,"translated":false}],"user_ratings_total":270,"website":"http://www.deencityfarm.co.uk/"},"status":"OK","place_id":"ChIJTXsnmB8GdkgRa0gMQn5Oo6s","address":"Deen City Farm, 39 Windsor Ave, London SW19 2RR, United Kingdom","categories":["animals"]}
