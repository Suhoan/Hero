It was amazing! The staff are probably the most polite, helpful and empathetic staff I have come across in a long  long time.\n\nEveryone was so helpful and the kids had a wonderful, wonderful time. Yes, there were a few tricky moments, handling a party of almost 30 kids can be quite the challenge, but everyone I spoke to was understanding and very kind.\n\nI have taken the time to write this because there has been some negative reviews about Oxygen Acton and I truly empathise with those affected.\n\nFrom the minute I arrived, the staff in charge of parking were excellent, the staff at the party check-in were friendly and patient, our host was amazing and the food was excellent. The kids had such an amazing time and all I can say is thank you! A big shout out to Nathan, Saro, the amazing kitchen staff on the last floor, the amazing staff at the canteen, the staff at the party check-in, every single one of you contributed to the success of this party.\nYou all made my child's 11th birthday so much more amazing and memorable.
