I’ve been taking kids to the centres for several years as a childminder, and now I go with my own daughter, who is 2.5years old. The children always love going to playgroups there, and get excited when they see their favourite Aunties (staff) there, especially Auntie Deni who is the life and soul of every stay and play session (they are never quite the same without her there, and certainly not as messy or as fun!)  Sarah on reception is just beyond lovely and always there to have a friendly chat and help out with any needs you may have, and the kids adore her! And then the actual stay and play staff are fab! Always friendly and approachable, and always putting the children first in the activities they set up. Like I said, Deni is just fantastic for this; she’s always so full of energy, never fails to put the kids first and thinks about what they would like best and how they would get the most out of the stay and play sessions. The creative messy play stations she sets out are always a big hit with the children and adults, and I’m so grateful for the opportunities the children get at Deni’s stay and play sessions. The singing sessions at the end of each playgroup are also much appreciated. They bring a great sense of structure to the playgroup, the children know that after tidy up time is singing and then home. The kids particularly enjoy Deni’s positive energy during singing at the end, they love to “pretend to be Auntie Deni” as my daughter says, and then proceed to sing tiny turtle with a really exaggerated bubble pop at the end!\nAs a mother and childminder, I’d honestly be lost without the incredible children centres in Abbey Wood and Thamesmead, they are run by the most dedicated and friendly staff team, they give support to both adults and children alike, and I for one am ever so grateful to have them by my side through the early years of raising my daughter.  I highly recommend anyone that lives locally in Abbey Wood and Thamesmead and has young children to check them out, they are a real lifeline to me, and to the children I look after!","time":1647359854,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Everline Komo","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115831597465995867899/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWFwRXzK1r0Dq1gRH0W9JxfAJSAsR788b4lhIawA2vXfA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"My son looks forward to his play groups everytime we pass by.

Polish staff member spent all the time talking to another Polish mother in their own language without paying any attention to kids.\nUsually kids get some fruits to eat at the end of each session, today this process was extremely rushed, fruits chopped to big pieces, apples had little paper labels/stickers on it so I doubt if fruits got washed before serving to kids. My wife pointed this to a member mentioned above but had no response, she just peeled the label off and walked away.\n\nWon't be returning as to me kids health and safety always come first.\n\nI understand it is pretty much a free service but there supposed to be professionals working who genuinely care about kids and who are not only there to pick up their salaries.","time":1513282148,"translated":false},{"author_name":"cennet okudan","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104175365013812616743/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLyC06K8Dyooo_oxWHJNZBs4u39jZWMRA-I5VL2MuEd=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"I take my child there and the stuffs are very helpful and friendly, always smiling.","time":1648839237,"translated":false}],"user_ratings_total":10,"website":"https://www.better.org.uk/children-centre/london/greenwich/discovery-childrens-centre?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=google_my_business"},"status":"OK","place_id":"ChIJtzzcXbOo2EcRTdi4ZDELwoQ","address":"Battery Rd, London SE28 0JN, United Kingdom","categories":["stay and play"]}
