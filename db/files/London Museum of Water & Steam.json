The engines are well preserved and look gorgeous. They run some of them on certain days, the working mechanisms are spectacular! There is a lot interaction, kids can press buttons, pump water and play. I was lucky to come by the time of live water bubble science session for kids. There are also outdoor areas, but I missed that due to the rain. The toilets are clean and tidy, there is hot water (obviously) and a lot of paper sheets. There is a nice cafe with museum items on the wall and a free parking.
