Not too busy along the day. Perfect place to go by yourself to sit and relax or go with friends, family and children. The workout area is located right in front of the children play ground. Ideal for parents looking to do a bit of workout, introduce their children the habit of exercise and then go to the playground. When snows this place is lovely as the same when is foggy, as incredible when is sunny. If you came on the 31st of December from there the views of the fireworks around London is perfect and not to mention that there will be some local fireworks too. Public restrooms by the Skate space. Ps: the views from the workout area to London skyline are fully visible in Autumn/Winter due after that due to trees leaf.
