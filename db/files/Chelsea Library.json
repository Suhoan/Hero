During my visit, I was shocked and disgusted to witness a live rat within the library premises. This incident has raised serious concerns about the library's cleanliness, maintenance, and overall commitment to ensuring a safe environment for its patrons.\n\nThe presence of a rat in a public facility such as a library is completely unacceptable. It not only poses health risks but also indicates a lack of proper pest control measures and maintenance practices. Libraries are supposed to be clean, serene spaces that foster learning and intellectual growth. However, encountering a rat running around clearly demonstrates a failure in maintaining a hygienic environment.","time":1684616259,"translated":false},{"author_name":"St John's Soup Kitchen","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111084297938628634759/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJJIM-i63Ej6v-sErEv4pdjiQcDZ6D9qzzsPoFEcn5cTw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 weeks ago","text":"Really lovely staff.
