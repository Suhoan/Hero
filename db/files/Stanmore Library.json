There is a small carpark just for library users at the back of the library. In the library, there is a nice small fairly cosy area for children to chill and read or browse for books. I think the selection of children books are pretty good. And if you can't find books in this library, you can go to your account online and reserve the book that you want and they will bring the books from other libraries for you and inform you via email once your book is ready for collection. Service can be slow sometimes but the staff are doing the best they can and they are super friendly and helpful. Its my child's favourite place to be and can easily borrow 10 books at a time! Just need to be mindful of their opening hours as they are not open for the whole day and not every day is necessarily the same closing time.
