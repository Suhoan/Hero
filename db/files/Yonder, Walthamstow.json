The route setting is interesting for all levels of difficulty.\n\nThere are good training facilities such as the Moon board and adjustable overhang spray board, along with a cafe bar, a yoga studio, occasional aerial classes, co-working studios, a pool table, and even a slide!\n\nDefinitely worth a visit for both new and experienced climbers, and there is a good series of events. The membership is good value compared to some walls in London. The shop is quite small, but they are one of the few UK stockists of Unparallel.\n\nMy only major gripes are that the grading is not just fairly hard (which I can adjust to), but can seem rather inconsistent, which can be off-putting to less experienced climbers. Also, other walls have longer weekend opening times.","time":1693430546,"translated":false},{"author_name":"david carqueijeiro","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105589382701590124139/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUupS5QF3NQj4iTW_F6nzQtmWnM87JXfpHz_aJIZ1yl9e0=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"yonder is a really cool place to hang out, work, eat and have great exercise.
