slot.\nThere's a small kiosk inside the bounds of the pools which has all the bits you'll need to keep yourself going too, including hot and cold drinks (cans), juice boxes for the kids (and me, love an apple and mango) and even some warm croissants! There are some changing rooms on site, but you'll have to keep your bags on you, which is easy to do with the amount of benches and empty space there is to claim.\nThis has been a great time out and one clearly enjoyed by our toddler, who especially enjoyed going between the huge jets and adorably small ones which seemed to be made just for her size.","time":1687601553,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Colin MacDonald","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101608333368395926194/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWRJf1p9ZgBVL6eROC4xrCTP_hijjUwj7DnrjFFlDfOIK4=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"4 months ago","text":"Not too busy on our last visit, safe, monitored, environment for children to paddle and cool off on hot days.

Renovated a year ago. Enormous place with 2 good size paddling pools and 1 fountain pool. Lots of changing facilities. They serve coffee ice-cream there, and there is also a very nice cafe next to it. More facilities include large playground, outdoor gym and mini-train that are all closeby.
