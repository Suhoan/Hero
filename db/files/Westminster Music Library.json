complimentary Wi-Fi which is easy to login into without having to give your personal details. All are quiet enough.\n\nOnly gripe is that, given it's proximity to nearby construction work (as of May 2019), the third-floor study area can get loud. Headphones with your own tunes are advised.\n\nOther than that, a good place to come if you're looking for a place to work or study.\n\nOne more thing, if you're into architecture and interior design, you'll appreciate the handsome mahogany stairs and bookshelves on the 2nd and 3rd floors.","time":1557488907,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Jawaher Kawhary","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100352173383013552535/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJszQ2RheAZGga8AAVLhs63xtTmEWbzlj7vUPolQsSy=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"My favorite library in all of London! Been going here for a year now and the history of the building is insane! Sir Isaac Newton’s observatory was once there.\n\nOther than that, the library offers fast wifi, a bathroom (albeit you do have to ask the librarian to unlock the door), and 2 pianos for anyone to practice on free of charge. It can get quite busy after working hours but there will always be a place to sit upstairs.\n\nThe librarians are very helpful and kind, they let me borrow a pen on two occasions. The downstairs area is beautiful with tall windows that let in the sun. 10/10 one of my favorite places in London.","time":1668248027,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Monica Gurung","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103998233356968987379/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJ89lV9AMc30f_BFASCrivNeUW9J8DVDTZkgFB1SoZ2=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"Such kind staff members.

In the end, she kindly suggested getting a library card so I could use the computers which solved the issues.
