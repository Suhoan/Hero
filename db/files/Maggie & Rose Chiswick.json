It’s great if it’s raining and you need a space to keep a small child contained (from crawling up to 3 I’d say). I took my 11 month old and he had a great time! There’s a small kitchen and a type of rocking horse. Some of the toys look tired and I was on high alert as a child had left bits of cheese everywhere and my little one has a dairy allergy.\n\nWe tried some food - a £5.50 dairy-free risotto by Poppets that seemed fine, if a little dry. My child refused to eat it. I had a £7.50 tuna cheese melt which came with a salad which would have been nicer had the leaves been washed.\n\nFine for a rainy day, rather than a special trip there.","time":1682277638,"translated":false},{"author_name":"A B.","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108394059182647950213/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocId6o284uo1KGFfuvocrkDuXhuKjdCxG_DXCjKxKJvb=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":2,"relative_time_description":"2 weeks ago","text":"I was so disappointed by our visit at Maggie and Rose café. It was all so tired looking and run down. The only baked goods to choose from were literally one muffin and one croissant. My hot drink tasted like it was made with dish water. Food and drink were served in takeaway cups/bags even though we were staying in. The staff seemed very unenthusiastic. The space has so much potential, it's a shame no-one seems to invest a little love in it and make it nice.
