The train left a little late and was busy, there was a good atmosphere. We had seats in the carriage where the barrels were so people were in a queue going past us, but it seemed to move quickly, and wasn't a problem. I chose a blood orange cider I'd never had before to try and didn't drink anything else, stuck with that, it was delicious! We left after the first trip to join the rest of our party who weren't on the train, but it was going to go there and back again (possibly twice) and we were welcome to stay on if we had wanted to.
