The gallery is not big. The impressionists collection is fantastic. Located at the top floor of the gallery, it has paintings of Monet, Manet, Van Gogh and more. The rest of the collection worth checking as well.\n\nThe building itself is interesting and inspiring. Particularly the staircase. The gallery is located in one of the wings of the Somerset House and the view of the inner yard is nice from its top floor windows.\n\nThe Gallery is a bit pricey as for its size. I personally think that the experience is worth these money.","time":1681113131,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Debby Benjamin","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112983059120540026871/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocItaSWIz5MXhhm08Fa2pxYAEw9lwPgoCdLoYfXyicC-=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"6 months ago","text":"It is just amazing. The setting is  beautiful. Manet, Monet, Sickert, Ruben's etc, they have so many, even the ceilings are painted yet every painting has plenty of  space. The Peter Doig exhibition was interesting, his paintings draw you in and seem to glow. . In every gallery  found myself  sitting in the centre of the room to take it all in. Staff are friendly.
