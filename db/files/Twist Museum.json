If you can go even earlier, i would recommend it. 2pm That's a good time to go because it gets busy very fast. The locker system is a bit tricky and confusing. The locker/cloakroom area is small it got packed, and there was no space, and there are only a few lockers for the number of people. The staff are friendly, helpful, and welcoming. Tickets are expensive. But i think for a day out with the kids, seeing something different is worth it, and it's also educational as well.
