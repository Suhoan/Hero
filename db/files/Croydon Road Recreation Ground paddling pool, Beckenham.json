Looked good on Google and it was a red-hot day.\nThe paddling pool is hazardous.  The filter pump was running and water clear, but the pool bottom slopes down to the centre, there are no flat bits. It is slippery and kids were slipping over frequently.  The joints in pool surface are broken, been repaired poorly and painted over a few times. Still, it is cool and fun as long as you take care.\nGreat shady grassy areas around for picnics etc. and for keeping an eye out on the play.\nPlayground has great and varied equipment,  each with soft material to land on. Some quite challenging. Even good trees to climb and bushes to explore. The areas between equipment is tarmac and brick, so watch young children when they move quickly from one to the next.\nAlso there are open areas for ball games and other fun sports.\n\nCafe and toilets a good walk away near tennis courts. Didn't use either.\nWould go again.","time":1694534583,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Sharon Gordon","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104326818398033894957/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWJpXIC8TD8FaoSa_NKsGN5QbB72aRZnIWBWjtqMxWBrZ2h=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"5 months ago","text":"It was great to visit this place for the Taste of the Caribbean event on 2 July.
