Was unaware that it even existed.  It has lots of staff all very knowledgeable along with a short video explaining the history of the palace and how it was restored on the 1930s.  The gardens are spectacular and it has a large children's play area and nice gifts shop and cafe.  Would recommend the cream tea.   If I lived closer would visit just to see the gardens again.

The palace can be navigated thanks to a thoroughly engaging audio guide that breaks down each room and even the garden outside and once you're done with that, there is an achingly beautiful garden to explore with benches that offer spectacular views of the London skyline. Of course there's also a café for those who'd like a break from exploring. This place will be money well spent and a day out thoroughly enjoyed by all. Give it a go, you won't regret it. Oh, and be sure to check out the six minute film that gives a brief rundown of the palace's history - quite interesting.","time":1694376364,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Mark Bennett","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104182853861214599769/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV74I2047w4mkU7tijmq79AF4PSLpAEf3Ozi9M0cULt1Xg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"The Art Deco house has design in every aspect of it: spacious, beautiful and exceptionally functional.
