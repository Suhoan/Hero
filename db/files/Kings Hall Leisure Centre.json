The functional and the weights area is always a huge mess and on most weights you can't even read the numbers, so it's a guessing game. Really need new dumbbells and the staff needs to go through regularly to remind people to put stuff back.","time":1698659288,"translated":false},{"author_name":"VALERIE G","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116464162537432142611/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKF50l-wbVl2nXPsodaNDGlIzYDxP52t_-J578Uppr6=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":2,"relative_time_description":"a week ago","text":"The place is out of date and needs updating especially the changing area near the swimming baths.

AVOID IT AT ALL COST! The staff at reception have a ‘computer says no’ attitude, almost as if they’re doing you a favour instead of their to provide a service. The pool is, dilapidated, old, and dingy, and the lockers retain your 20p after usage - and look as though they could easily be broken into. There’s no option to even use your own padlock if you have one.
