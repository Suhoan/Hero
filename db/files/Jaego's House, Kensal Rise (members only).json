For the price you pay I’m afraid this is a big bust if you’re intending to use it on the weekend. The major areas which have led me to cancel the membership is as follows\n1. Good luck getting onto any classes on the weekend. Not sure what is happening here. There’s website squatters who just book everything in advance and there’s limited variety on the weekend. Then any of the special events - again completely booked within a couple of days. I am sure that proper etiquette is not being reinforced.\n2. The overcrowding situation is totally intolerable, this is worse that just going to a regular soft play.\n3. The restaurant has limited foods, it’s overpriced and be prepared to wait over 30mins for food\n4. There are limited toys in the restaurant and on the 3rd floor. The toys they have are broken and pretty worn down. Kids get into fights constantly and again what am I paying for.\n5. Did I mention how busy it is.? Here’s a pick at 11:50. The noise is wild and generally this is totally uncomfortable for all.\n6. I really don’t know why they don’t offer weekend membership I feel like this is just so overpriced","time":1699790035,"translated":false},{"author_name":"gabriella aquilina","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116193156003868522532/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVpBS24j6_c16oENdLpqs6ywXek-nQYstaofF5fxtYJSYM=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a week ago","text":"I looked after my son full time and having to go from one playgroup to another library to classes scattered all over the city was exhausting. It left very little energy for the actual joy of parenting. By the time my daughter was born, Jaegos opened its doors and the whole experience of mothering was transformed. I have a place I can go to that everyone is kind, welcoming and helpful, with a space that is so thoughtfully organised around families (the whole family) that it’s hard most days to tell who enjoys it more- my eldest whose 8, my daughter whose 2 or my husband and I. The memberships are flexible, the pricing is really generous considering everything you’re offered and the classes are brilliant. I eat better there than in most restaurants in the city, and it really is an all in one concept for all your families needs. I’m grateful to say three generations of my family enjoy it weekly and I’m so grateful to Charlie and the fantastic people that make is such an indispensable element of our parenting experience. If your considering joining, don’t think twice.","time":1700567212,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Will N.","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106684984108372994543/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUXHW1VcHY3iUulG0i3JaAjJBcR0lHJvQmUMH0eMSssoA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2","rating":2,"relative_time_description":"2 weeks ago","text":"Jaegos has great potential, but its current performance falls short of expectations. Staff turnover is notably high, and there appears to be a lack of effective management. When issues arise, such as my recent experiences, it seems that only a young receptionist is available to address them.\n\nI find it increasingly frustrating that simple tasks like ordering a coffee or using the gym can disrupt the entire operation.\n\nOn Halloween, I took my children to a pumpkin carving lesson, which consisted of a collection of old pumpkins, knives, and no supervision. I expressed concerns about safety to the receptionist, but received only a shrug in response.\n\nFurthermore, the play area encountered flooding due to a storm overflow, making our visit quite unpleasant. It smelt like an open toilet - staff came out to photograph but no one apologised nor have done since.\n\nIt felt like an ordeal trying to locate staff for assistance at PC World.\n\ni’ve written numerous emails but it’s getting very tiresome trying to get them to take more care of their customers, nearly all of whom are tired parents with small children\n\nIt's high time for improvement and better coordination within your establishment.","time":1700388168,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Wakiel Tawafi","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112812671337989177084/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKJt-_lhWUIMszn6xRFGg2-C9X8bhOIQ82luPqZ20Bh=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"in the last week","text":"So we purchases a £250 membership and ended up not being able to go.
