They offer all kinds of services, like the soft play, adventure and birthday parties. Loved the fact that they had  three sections in the soft play for the babies, toddlers and the older children. In addition, it was great we could accompany the kids as well, running around definitely left us breaking a sweat!!!\n\nCame here with a younger brother and some of his friends from school, they absolutely loved it, we went through the immersive jungle experience with the guide jungle drew and had a blast. They had some really cool activities for the kids and taught them great things. Then straight after went to play in the soft play area where we ordered some dinner for the kids through the QR code in the table.\n\nAlso we came here to celebrate a birthday, booking the party was really easy and you don’t have to decide the food you want straight away, the staff were so helpful with explaining how the party works and it was absolutely great knowing I wouldn’t need to lift a finger as they do everything for you from the set up, to the cake cutting/packing and the clean up. It was also nice to hear that they could cater for the children with allergies with alternatives for their food and dessert.\n\nWe have been here on multiple occasions and will definitely keep coming back, recommend booking the soft play online, it’s really easy and it guarantees you a table. If you are walking in, the weekdays are the best days to do so as there isn’t as many people compared to the weekends. The weekends can become packed quite quickly.\n\nThere is plenty of parking here during the weekdays, it does become slightly packed on the weekends when there are birthday parties.\n\nThe place was clean and very hygiene friendly, making sure anyone entering the soft play is wearing socks, and hoovering between sessions for any crumbs on the floor.\n\nThe toys in the adventure store were so soft and I could not resist buying one for myself and my brother.\n\nStaff here are so friendly and helpful, although it sometimes maybe a bit difficult to reach them through the phone due to how busy they are I suggest giving them an email and they will respond when they can, definitely a 5 star service all round and would recommend this place to anyone with kids between 1 to 12 years old!!!","time":1694289658,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Eliza Mosoiu","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103213575333001156088/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLWkeRWbBTxjxNKxgBJO8R4aUG0RnhFBUPXdMXj0oGM=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 weeks ago","text":"Amazing experience, the staff is very friendly, my daughter had an amazing time playing in the adventure zone.
