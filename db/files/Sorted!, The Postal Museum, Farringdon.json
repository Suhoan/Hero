One site contains the actual museum and a cafe while the other site houses the rail ride and children's play area. Both sites have a gift shop.\nFor us the rail ride was the best part of the visit. You get to ride in a converted postal train and follow a small part of the underground track that was once used to transport mail bags around London. Along the ride you get to learn more about the history of the postal rail system.\nThe museum itself is rather small but well laid out. There are different stands showing how the postal system, stamps, delivery methods and uniforms have changed through history. The are many points where children can try on replica uniforms. Children can also design a badge and design a future uniform.\nI didn't see inside the play area but it was very popular and fully booked out for the time of our visit. It can be accessed separately to the museum and is a separate cost so you can visit the play area on its own if you wish which could be useful to local residents.\nWe also didn't experience the cafe first hand but the food looked ok and prices were comparable to high street coffee shops.\nIt was good to see that screen displays in the museum were signed for deaf people but this was not the case on the rail ride.\nIn the museum section there were other facilities including lockers so you don't have to carry unnecessary items around with you, cycle storage and an area to hire for parties.\nToilets were plentiful on both sites and were well maintained. Each was a self contained unit for use by males or females.\nOverall we enjoyed our visit and I would happily recommend it to others.","time":1699885162,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Edmund Yu","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106736578501695635667/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWbDZfJRDfsNmb0KtXHv_9PyV_pF-Ufvvvpo46adlaU_2s=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"The Postal Museum offers a nice ride, but the exhibition is somewhat small, though still decent. It seems to cater well to kids with plenty of interactive elements. With a National Art Pass, the £8 admission is reasonable, but I agree that it might not be worth the full £16 price. The highlight is definitely the mail ride. A tip would be to keep an eye out for 2-for-1 deals that National Rail often offers, which can make the visit more budget-friendly.","time":1696934216,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Rae","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103365653188100405328/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVBFXzerTMpg6TqAfnScD-KJU-XzEbzvNc6QW65AxccHohk=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"Had an absolutely brilliant time at the postal museum.

The trains are quite small, as you can imagine they weren't originally designed for rides... we got put in a compartment together, it was a little tight, but not too bad. (I'd imagine if you had older kids you'd probably need more than one compartment!) Upon entry you pop any bags in a locked cabinet and, once on train they then make sure your compartment is secure. The trains are electric / battery and follow a little route round with a couple of stops to tell you about the history. It was a good little ride, and certainly a bit different. I was surprised my son (who loves trains), didn't rate it very highly - I guess he just didn't like how dark it was perhaps?\n\nAfter the train, there are a few bits to look at before heading out of this building and back to the museum entrance. The museum lobby area has a cafe, gift shop and some toilets. There is a sort of children's trail that the kids can follow, and as they go round the museum there are a couple of bits that are interactive (create your own stamp for example). Kids found some of this interesting, but there was also a lot to read. I didn't realise there was so much history to even know about - but there was!\n\nWhilst we had a nice time, and glad we went, I'm not sure the museum quite hit the mark with the little people. I think on some of the interactive bits there were things missing (even just paper to send messages on the air tube thing), that if fixed etc. would have made the experience better.","time":1695480854,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Stefan F.
