I found a castle, what is the Bruce Castle Museum & Haringey Archives (‚Ä¶ as you can see in the pictures.) I saw nice old trees, I was just wondering about the story of their life (‚Ä¶ what they can tell us.) There are playground with a pool for children. There are possibilities for activities as playing basketball, tennis, walking, running, exercising on your own or as part of the organised group (‚Ä¶ what I saw). The  üöú cutting the grass was an attraction (‚Ä¶ a made a record about it.) It was impressive how the üöú was turning around the trees.\nI found one of the entrances an ice cream üöê too. I did not try but probably you should.\n‚Ä¶ but unfortunately, I realised, I could not use my phone without problem.
