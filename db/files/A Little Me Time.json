with air conditioning. ‚ô•Ô∏è\n\nAlthough the food pricing is comparable to or slightly higher than that of Chinese restaurants outside, it relates to low-sugar and low-salt healthy seasoning combinations, small amounts of homemade food (the cost is higher), and the cost of indoor space for toddler playing, which is truly healthy and kids-family friendly.\n\nCompared to those general cafes, the neatness and quietness are a bit messy, but come on, it is a parent-child restaurant, so things should be a bit messy that is just right. The staff have a warm heart if you raise your requirements to them face to face.\n\nIf you do not like noise, then recommend having takeaway food & drinks, especially bubble tea is more low-sugar and healthy; if you do not mind noise and being exposed to little ones walking around, then enjoy food and a cute atmosphere in-store. üòä","time":1683801345,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Jeanne Hipolito","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109453696994201286782/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXG0y5O1ljxUkw4JHMHsKxv7WxB11Pyq6-w-EwT_VedtBs=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"4 months ago","text":"I live locally and go to this cafe quite frequently. If you desire a showroom looking cafe, then this is not the place for you. This is a cafe that mums like me can feel relaxed while our kids run around and have fun in a safe environment. The toys are not fresh from the box quality, but hey, kids can still have fun playing with them. Compared to bringing kids to expensive softplays, this is a more affordable option where you can come often without breaking the banks. I always suggest this place when i am meeting up with my other mum friends. The staff and the owners are very friendly.
