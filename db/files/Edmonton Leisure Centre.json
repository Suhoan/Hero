To be honest the whole place is a shambles, it's a mess, the facilities and activities are severely lacking. There is hardly anything on the timetable. I normally use this place for the softplay for my child but will no longer. The area needs updating, its not kept an eye on at all. The area is unmanned so anyone can just walk in where young children are, very dangerous. The cafe is no longer there so you are unable to purchase snacks or drinks (this had been shut down for at least 3-4 years now)The toilets are filthy, not kept clean as is the play area itself. There is no clean up between sessions. Mess is left on tables from previous sessions. Staff does not come in to do safety checks,\n\nAs for the centre itself, the customer service is abismal! Staff with either a don't care or very laid back attitude. I have been in and the reception has been unmanned more than once so again anyone could just walk in off the street. The phone is left ringing for ages. Again the area is unkept. Whoever has taken over this centre has let it go way down hill. Enfield Council needs to come in and actually have all look at how the place is being run. To be honest it needs to shut down asap!","time":1698334338,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Bernadette ‚ÄúSugarbabe‚Äù Mitchell","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107016194313584793205/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXClF9qkD2S9NS8zM1eb7wBdSXJ3ryUPK2cHnO5ZqtBm7PV=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":2,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"This place has gone hill over the last year.
