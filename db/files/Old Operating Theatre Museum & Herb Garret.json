Be aware that it is a narrow spiral staircase up to the top with nowhere to stop, but take your time and you will be rewarded.\nUp in the loft of the old apothecary store is a great little museum showing how far medicine has come along. Plenty of interesting items to see and read about, then there is the crown jewel of the museum. The amazingly well preserved operating theatre with it's recently renovated glass ceiling.\nThere is a small shop near the counter with some fun items for kids and big kids. The staff are all welcoming and friendly.
