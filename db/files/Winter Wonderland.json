The decorations and lights makes it very festive and Christmassy. It's well organised, great queue management, it has plenty of bars and places to grab mulled wine/cider. Also it has enough toilets. The only down side for me is the menu- too many churros stands. The menu in the Bavarian village is pretty much the same among all stands, repetitive and not much variety.

The ice slide was great fun, the haunted mansion was laughable it was so bad, the VR ride was ok but I doubt we'd pay to go on it again. I paid for fast track tickets but as we went early in the day they weren't needed as it was pretty quiet. My son loved the fun houses and enjoyed santa land. The ice kingdom was good but one of the worst themes yet. There were lots off food options which are very overpriced, we paid £6.50 for a spiral potato on a stick and £9 for a German sausage which neither if us could eat as they were horrible. Overall it was a good day but we'll probably give it a miss for a few years.","time":1700490590,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Vivian Wijaya","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108197367137255931141/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUsTRABuLkWBKbJDKShv16tT_3kHEBx5mIKBJsfSqlS-e4=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a week ago","text":"Expensive, but a great festive fun.
