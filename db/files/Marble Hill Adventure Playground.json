It is now open till 5pm, giving more time to play after napping.\nThe Playground is very safe - no swings or big slides or high climbing. And there are great play-workers there playing with the kids and doing all sorts of activities. That means I can relax and enjoy a cup of coffee!!! And yes - there is great coffee there now as well!!\nThe kids can play inside and outside, so a great place to come rain or shine. Our favorite so far has been the big sand pit with a parasol over it.\n\nThere is also a brilliant Adventure Playground for over 5s, where the kids play independently and the parents are not allowed. You can go in together on the family days (first Saturday of every month) with the younger ones as well. My daughter absolutely loved it!\n\nDisclaimer: I am one of the trustees of the charity that operates the playcentres. So you can see I am very excited about it :)) Come and try yourself!!! And feel free to ask any questions.","time":1524154322,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Esther Winn","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109796866231733462188/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUFt8LW1WFBo4v8bqQdg-ejr1mU8Ord1eXILaF1fWECGkA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"The staff are extremely attentive.
