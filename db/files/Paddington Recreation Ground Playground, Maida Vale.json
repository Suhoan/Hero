let him have fun through a canine path very nice and I must say well done and also well maintained.\nI always enter from the main entrance in Carlton vale, where you enter and find yourself in front of a roundabout, yes you go to the left you go towards the car park and the dog area that I have just listed.\nIf we continue on foot instead we can notice on the left a path inside the vegetation which is also well cared for, we continue forward and on the right we can see how the photos I have put of the very distinct playgrounds for children, the section for older children and the section for younger children, a little further on there is a very nice play area with miniature palaces, I noticed that in this park there are various playgrounds that can be easily booked , even if I see many school groups training so I don't know how free it can be but don't give up if you are interested in phone calls.\nI could see a professional playing sports field with the racing ring going around the field.\nIn addition, like all parks, I noticed other large areas where you can indulge yourself and possibly let go of the dogs and why not let go of the children who run and have fun.\nI leave included some photos that could be useful for you, such as the parking hours and the bulletin board with telephone numbers.","time":1678721640,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Abdulhaleem
