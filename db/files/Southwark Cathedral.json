No doubt about it, the Southwark Cathedral cat is one of the stars! We were there to see The Museum of The Moon, which was very cool, but this famous resident put in an elegant, if aloof, appearance.\nThis was a busy evening, but I would recommend visiting also at quieter times when you can fully be with your own thoughts... Like many religious buildings, it can inspire contemplation, stillness and introspection - all too rare in our always-connected, social media-driven world. I am personally not religious, but I do appreciate the resonance of such places and the opportunity to just Be.","time":1699230453,"translated":false}],"user_ratings_total":2904,"website":"https://cathedral.southwark.anglican.org/"},"status":"OK","place_id":"ChIJ1aSDEVcDdkgRcnd_8l9Qbh4","categories":["historic"],"address":"London Bridge, London SE1 9DA, United Kingdom"}
