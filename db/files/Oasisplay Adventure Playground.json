I was a regular. The staff (Debbie and I think his name was David) allowed me to help them run the site. They used to allow me to hold the keys.\n\nI especially enjoyed Saturday afternoons between a certain time as Debbie use to sell beef burgers in bun (prepared on barbeque ) I think a burger was £0.20 I recall these being delicious. This site use to farm hens/ chickens. I also use to help putting them away in the hutch. I will never forget my mistake of rushing one of the chicks where I accidently stood on it. I think it died instantly. I told Debbie who was very kind and said just be careful next time......I apologised to the chicken who the chick belonged too as I believe that they understand English.","time":1653453777,"translated":false},{"author_name":"James Marasco-Rinieri","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100655058487392167623/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUrvkq2ku61Ffr1jtMgkef4aNRYLkv5K14hIeFdzYI4UlY=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":3,"relative_time_description":"3 weeks ago","text":"Really good place with good staff","time":1699703146,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Bolaji Oloyede","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115305622119099409229/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKWdc-mlu_SA0d9b9rV-1HoCY0kXzwpFznnIKDAd6m7=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"Children loves being here.
