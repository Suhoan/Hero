Unfortunately i learned it the hard way when my child was attending the so called nursery. Their ofsted report highlights how careless they are by often leaving the children unsupervised. I wish I had read that report before sending my child there. They were careless, loveless uncaring and behold the faces those so called nursery care assistant would put on when you go to pick up your child at the end of a day, was so different to the one they had when I turned up unannounced. I had to withdraw my child. All the parents I had a chance to speak to, were extremely disappointed with the service and it was one upsetting story to another.
