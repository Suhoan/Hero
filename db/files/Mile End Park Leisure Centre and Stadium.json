It is reasonably clean although I have seen lumps of hair at the bottom of the pool on more than one occasion. The problem is in the cleanliness of the surrounding areas.\n\nFirstly some people leave their belongings next to the pool. Trainers, bags, jackets. In that same area swimmers walk and enter the pool.\n\nParents watching their children on the stands pass through this same area in street footwear.\n\nThe same parents accompany children to the showering facilities.\n\nThere are solutions like different entrance and exit for people watching or disposable slip on shoe covers.\n\nIt seems that there is a lack of money invested.\n\nThe changing cabinets are filthy. In all my visits I have never seen a cleaner.\n\nTo sum up a long story short, really poor effort on the swimming pool side of things.","time":1692195309,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Юрій Печериця","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115067071708370207236/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX-35LZr_AK_NJdE1lgvmDIDCNweO1_XyUFO1sJgO8mYhL2=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"Mile End Park is an urban oasis nestled in the heart of East London, and it's nothing short of a delightful escape from the bustling city streets.
