The journey begins with a scenic walk through Greenwich Park, culminating in a steep climb that rewards you with a spectacular view of the Observatory peeking through the trees. Turning around, you're greeted by breathtaking views of London's skyline and its famous landmarks.\n\nAt the Observatory's entrance, the magnificent Shepherd Gate Clock, symbolising Greenwich Mean Time, welcomes visitors. The Meridian Courtyard offers a unique experience of standing on the Prime Meridian Line, a geographical marker dividing the eastern and western hemispheres.\n\nThe tour includes Flamsteed House, a masterpiece by Sir Christopher Wren, which served as the residence and workplace of the Astronomers Royal. The exhibitions delve into the intricacies of time and longitude, enhancing the educational aspect of the visit.\n\nThe Octagon Room, the Observatory's oldest section commissioned by King Charles II, captivated me with its historical significance and unique architecture designed for celestial observations.\n\nThe Observatory is home to an array of remarkable astronomical instruments, such as the Great Equatorial Telescope under its distinctive onion dome and William Herschel’s Telescope in the Astronomers Garden. These instruments, including John Harrison's marine timepieces essential for sea navigation, are not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing.\n\nWhile understanding the technicalities of these instruments might be challenging, the Observatory offers talks to enhance comprehension and appreciation.\n\nOverall, the visit to the Royal Observatory is not only educational but also a must-see for anyone visiting Greenwich. The nearby gift shop and dining options add to the overall experience.","time":1701001597,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Michael “Mike” DeBurgh","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100833302639316645236/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVjDvugtaMcBmLoOHtDpl-9RFv8RXCcaIz5Cs4UHwTQMFMI=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"in the last week","text":"Outstanding museum.

First and foremost, it offers one of the best panoramic views of the city. Perched on a hill in Greenwich Park, the observatory provides an unbeatable vantage point to admire the sprawling metropolis of London. The sight of iconic landmarks like the Shard, Canary Wharf, and the meandering River Thames is simply awe-inspiring, especially during sunset or in the evening when the city lights up.\n\nThe second highlight of the observatory is the Greenwich Meridian Line, which holds historical and geographical significance as the Prime Meridian. This is the line that divides the Eastern and Western Hemispheres of the Earth, making it a spot where you can stand in two different hemispheres simultaneously. The Meridian Courtyard, with its marked line and world clocks, allows visitors to engage with this concept in an engaging and interactive way.\n\nThe observatory itself is a beautiful historic building, offering a glimpse into the history of astronomy and navigation. It's a captivating experience for both science enthusiasts and history buffs.\n\nIn summary, the Greenwich Observatory combines the best London view with a unique opportunity to straddle two hemispheres at the Greenwich Meridian Line. It's an educational and visually stunning attraction that's well worth a visit when exploring London.","time":1697231730,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Tas A","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118322289133829114029/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVBjdbjpyaa1neFPzswgim90vUMnCMgTv9vWuzKJmsE3g=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"5 months ago","text":"A very nice place to be with family, friends and young kids. The place is so lovely. The information is well spread out throughout the area. The walk towards the Prime meridian is steep but scenic. You can see the skyline of Thames river. It is better to have the tickets advance. There is also a nice garden before going to the top of the observatory. We loved that place also. The museum is very informative. I love the section about the utensils and the swords and information on ships. Don’t miss that. Try reading something. It will give a glimpse into the life of the past sailors/ sea life.","time":1687325712,"translated":false},{"author_name":"MANISHA SHAH","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100861375973043986573/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXp0PTzXgX7ze1_rF3v5daUlp6DImY3EAwnObDotpF8ug=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"It was a great experience. The prime Meridian coordinates were actually showing in car park outside the observatory gate and inside on line it was 5 degrees off.
