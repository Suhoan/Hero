The section for older kids is great and my 3 and a half year old loved it…but the ‘0-3’ section is shocking. Just a really small room with one small ball pit and a few other basic soft play floor items. Room barely padded so doesn’t even feel safe - I’d rather just play in my own front room with my baby. This room needs A LOT of work to be able to charge people for it.
