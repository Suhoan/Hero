As per website we booked a session- went for the morning as wanted to partake in the Box Rocket workshop too. Arrived for the 10am start and was ushered to the basement for the start. It was some fun with words and actions then some time spent exploring Planet Nan with some activities including dress up, clearing up the beach, playing some bubble fun etc. after this we decided to get crafting decorating some wooden spoons and completing some paper crafts/ colouring exercises. Lots to explore in the building both down and upstairs not to mention the big outside play area too. We had lunch in the cafe, were allowed to eat our packed lunch there (we asked and they seemed friendly). Great toilet facilities and back for more fun and play outside - plenty of theme around The Storm Whale story as celebrating 10th year anniversary. Ended the day having a browse at the bookstore.","time":1692335782,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Maja PEDNEKAR","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113014169029004957836/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJrQ-o0J65wANnJ932hXmvH_V_S1ZpzzT-4DQ4bETje=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"Great indoor and outdoor playground. Kids had a lot of fun. You pay the entry fee and stay all day if you want. There are extra interactive activities which are better to book ahead as they are very popular - for  extra fee.
