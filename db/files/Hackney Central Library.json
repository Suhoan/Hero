How in 2023 do you have such a terrible archaic service including print.\n.\nIf you print like example 20 pages of several documents the customer service at the reception have to literally look on their screen at your name in the queue to manually add up with their fingers to see how many total you have and then proceed to print for you. And it prints 1 page at a time in such a slow pace its like watching paint dry on a wall.\n\nI mean seriously in 2023 with all the modern technology form of printing, Hackney Libraries are stuck in the 80s. Everywhere else in US, Canada and some parts of UK,  you simply go to the printer, scan your library card,  at a computer monitor next to the printer, it'll automatically tell you Total pages you have, you decide if you want to print all or simply select what you want to print,  you pay with your contactless card  and in seconds 20 pages are printed. You don't interact with reception or administrative unless your out of paper or a jam in the printer. There are several printers and everything is so quick. In seconds you are good to go.\n\nDon't get me started on fact that in 2023 Hackney libraries do not have MS Word, excel or any office on their computers, all you can open print are pdf. YOU CANNOT OPEN A WORD DOC OR EXCEL\n\nHackney you might as well just close all your libraries.  It's not Worth it. It's ancient and archaic with books that are 50yrs old..\n.\nMost of time the computers don't work to even get on the internet and most of the staff can never help you, most basiclc tech know how is above them.\n.\nPublic Computers are suppose to be timed maximum 2 hrs so one person doesn't soend 10hrs on it\n.\nAbsolutely terrible and embarrassing  to call yourself a library.\n.\nToday 23 Sept  2023 I was desperate in need of print I visited 4 Hackney libraries including Mare Street and Dalston Kingsland and all their computer systems were down so they referred me to Clapton Library (the only one that waa orking) and it was the worst of the worst. I will not even get into how frustrating an experience it was.\n.\nI will never enter any Hackney library again.

I don't know what your policy is on protecting books and staff, but we were only trying to rent two books. It left my son really confused and I was lost for words on how to explain, what had just happened.
