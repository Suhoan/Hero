I felt so disoriented when I entered it because I was not expecting that high level of noise inside a library, the street was quieter! It was more like being in a football stadium. I could have ignored the noise with noise canceling earphones but what was even more disturbing was the employees attitude towards their WORK. Not only employees were the main source of the noise pollution, mostly gossiping because everyone could hear their conversations; but also, their lack of help and disinterest in doing their job was borderline condescending towards me. I’m hoping others have a better experience but from what I’ve read here, I’m not alone in this. At least I won’t take that dreadful experience too personal.","time":1648866507,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Jack Morby","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103830638704465855830/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUagIjyhK3SN4G_IJHrfOq6Ixas8BupvJk4Pa5FZRGMDA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"3 months ago","text":"Great library and fantastic friendly and helpful staff!","time":1691418869,"translated":false}],"user_ratings_total":27,"website":"https://www.lbhf.gov.uk/libraries/find-your-library/askew-road-library"},"status":"OK","place_id":"ChIJmzAn0DEOdkgRk7jJ0PCVgCU","address":"87-91 Askew Rd, London W12 9AN, United Kingdom","categories":["libraries"]}
