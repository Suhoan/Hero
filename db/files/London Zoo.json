I really liked that most of the animals had free-range pavilions like the monkeys and birds,because I've seen in other zoos cages can be small. Butterfly paradise was absolutely amazing!! All the staff were extremely helpful and shared some facts about the animals. I had the 10am ticket and went straight to the across the road and I was there by myself first to see zebras, first to see giraffes!! Toilets well maintained. Free maps at the entrance.

The zoo is accessible via the outer circle (Regent’s Park). The closest tube station is Camden Town, Baker Street or Chalk Farm or you simply hop on a bus (88, 274). There is a huge parking lot in front of the zoo too.\n\nYou can either buy tickets on the day or you pre-book your ticket. They have lots of membership options available if you plan to return more often. Children under the age of 2 go for free and children/ adults with additional needs qualify for a companion ticket.\n\nThe zoo is divided into two parts connected with two tunnels.\nYou can find all sorts of animals in the zoo. However, the creepy crawlers center is the best. You can even walk with the spiders. They have all sorts of activity packs for children, and have seasonal workshops that are free of charge once you purchase a ticket.\n\nCheck out the time slots for shows or download the zoo app.\n\nThere are lots of food and coffee options. They have a big canteen offering fresh food. It is a bit more expensive though. They have lots of options to warm up baby bottles or heat up food in the microwave free of charge.\n\nThe zoo staff is very helpful and friendly and are happy to support with everything.\n\nThere are lots of indoor places in case of rain. There is a souvenir shop at the very end before leaving the zoo. You can obviously use the exit without going through the shop, which is quite nice if you come here often.\n\nI can highly recommend the zoo to everyone no matter the age!","time":1700682828,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Andy V","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108091694248358703172/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWDxN_zd-T7lPc_BMNQiCwolGb9zZjCLInoPRRmdzKdmoi7=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"During our recent visit to London Zoo, we had an absolutely wonderful time at this attraction. We spent roughly four hours exploring the place and covered about 3 miles on foot. What I found particularly helpful was the condensed layout of the site, especially compared to other places like Whipsnade. It allowed us to move quickly between different areas, making the most of our time.\n\nOne of the standout features was the spider exhibit. What sets it apart is the ability to actually walk in and observe the spiders up close. No glass panels separating us, just an open and immersive experience. It was a rare and fascinating opportunity.\n\nThe giraffes were another highlight of our visit. They're simply amazing creatures. The way they were showcased was beautiful and it's clear that a lot of thought goes into making the visit enjoyable.\n\nIn summary, our time at this attraction was nothing short of delightful. It's a condensed and engaging experience, making it perfect for those looking to make the most of their visit to London in a relatively short amount of time.","time":1698008307,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Jahzi Ider","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108687430163517258730/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVb-vIqQrvolA0ItKFGuulFEkmwUGHHlUJViMDcIjxlKHU=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"2 weeks ago","text":"Took the kids on Sunday 12th Nov.\nWas a little bit wet and cold so most of the Animals where in hibernation but we saw plenty.\n\nBring your own snacks especially for kids as you will save a lot.
