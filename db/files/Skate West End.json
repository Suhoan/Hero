The rink is quite small for the amount of people they let in for each session, it gets crowded and there’s no flow to it, you keep having to stop to wait for people to skate forward. They also let people skate with their shopping bags and coats held in their hands which isn’t safe and adds to the chaos. Music is really loud in one particular spot and cannot be heard anywhere else. Lots of people just stopping at the edge to chat to their friends at the bar which disrupts those who want to skate. Staff isn’t really paying attention to anything but time, a lot of which is wasted queueing for skates or waiting for crowds to move. Also be prepared that you might get wrong size skates or two different size skates.","time":1700995285,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Kevin Sullivan","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113287840689496977555/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLaXHxkJHcomizpjJyfn6tsC4LhoX-8YeRpKTYW1y8a=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"in the last week","text":"Great experience for me and my 6 y/o. Not a ton of space, but also wasn't real crowded when we were there.

We were pleasantly surprised by how great the staff was; they're mostly young, but had positive and friendly attitudes that enhanced the experience, and they acted with professional and seemed genuinely interested in making our visit a fun one (which it definitely was)! While there are multiple signs prohibiting guests from using phones/cameras to take pictures while skating, multiple staff members eagerly offered to take photos for us, and proceeded to take multiple angles to make sure we were happy with them.","time":1701599309,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Nabihah","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107600324702091950438/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLVQZ7O5JTt7xFD6Qck4o6l7cEXpK2rmMN6nebSIH-V=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"in the last week","text":"Fab ice rink.
