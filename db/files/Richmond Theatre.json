Although it lasted for two and half hours but they kept the attraction for the stage.\n\nI really recommend Richmond visitors to to find some time to attend one of the many shows in the theater.\n\nRichmond Theatre is a beautiful and historic theater located in Richmond, London. It was built in 1899 and has been the venue for many famous performers and plays over the years. The interior of the theater is stunning, with ornate decorations and a grand auditorium that seats over 800 people.\n\nThe theater hosts a variety of shows, including musicals, plays, comedy shows, and more. The seating is comfortable and the sightlines are good from most seats in the theater, so you'll have a great view of the stage no matter where you sit.\n\nOverall, Richmond Theatre is a great venue for anyone looking to see a show in London and experience some of the city's theatrical history","time":1684486165,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Donna","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100563425970772290989/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWuRmLsOsoBtsaUGO6vgl8rwzbRuHIHiZRjdWr-K-H6hA0R=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6","rating":3,"relative_time_description":"a week ago","text":"Recently visited to see the Enfield Haunting which has some quiet, atmospheric parts... and they were ruined by the usher at the back who left his walkie talkie on so we kept hearing the feedback.
