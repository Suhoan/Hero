Ann-Marie was a huge helping hand on the day and ensured everything was set up for us so we could fully enjoy ourselves. Would highly recommend this venue.

The facilities are well kept and safe for the little ones who thoroughly enjoyed themselves and literally did not want to leave.  We did not have our entertainment, no fault of their own and the kids did not miss it one bit.
