We had initially chosen the hotel with high hopes for a relaxing getaway, but our stay was marred by significant noise disturbances.\n\nOur room, located on the first floor, was subject to constant noise from the hotel staff moving supplies and equipment for an event as late as 1 AM and truck loading/unloading activities that began as early as 6 AM and continued throughout the day. This ongoing disruption affected our sleep and overall enjoyment of our stay.\n\nWe raised this issue with the front desk on two separate occasions, and while the staff assured us they would get back to us to address the issue, we were never contacted or informed of any resolution.\n\nFurthermore, during our stay, the hotel was hosting a major event, which seemed to take precedence over the comfort of regular guests. We believe that all guests, regardless of the occasion, deserve a peaceful and enjoyable stay.\n\nWe sincerely hope that the hotel management takes action to prevent such disturbances for future guests. While we understand that events are crucial for business, it is equally important to ensure that all guests have a pleasant experience.\n\nOur intention is to provide an honest review to help other guests make informed decisions. We had expected a tranquil and pleasant stay but left feeling disappointed and overlooked.\n\nWe hope the hotel takes steps to address these issues and provides a more enjoyable experience for future guests.","time":1696983321,"translated":false},{"author_name":"violetab brownstead","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117284455860471331396/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU5_lbd438TBSEuKltoONmCf93dPQwv_TIeoGmVq9uD4yEi=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"The hotel helped me get my airport transportation from Heathrow to the hotel. The hotel is beautiful and very elegant. I stayed in a very spacious executive suite, I loved walking in a room where a welcome fruit bowl and treat awaits for me. The bathroom offers shower, tub and a warm seated toilet. My bed was comfortable. This hotel has a club lounge where I enjoyed late snacks and a small breakfast. I also ate at the JW steakhouse on site and had a fabulous dining experience. Staff walks extra mile for you. This hotel is a walking distance to shopping.\nAnd my cherry on top was the pastries sold at their coffee shop. However please allow me shout out at staff for being absolutely amazing: I lost a bag and it was found. When my sister and I were leaving our room with heavy bags, the housekeeper supervisor and her aid ran to help us and took our luggage to the elevator without asking. Thank you so much for caring!

If it wasn’t for the location I’d have given it a one star.\nIt took nearly 20 minutes to get checked in and when I had finally checked in the queue was even longer. Maybe it was a busy time but there were empty desks so maybe they could have put more people on the front desk. These are all things such 5star hotels should be better at.\nThat of course is not enough to leave a 2 star. The main reason is that the place really needs a refurb.\nThe room I am writing this from reminds me of my Grandmothers bedroom, the lighting is old fashioned and the room is not that big at all.\nFor £630 I expected so much more.","time":1700845834,"translated":false},{"author_name":"balooko31","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103227112695439021803/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXNaJPXgzp2jaTa5kZROlDCWT26yTpJmC6POcq9GH2qxg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"4 weeks ago","text":"The negative is that in my room (#758), the ability to get in and out of the bathtub to shower was a bit dangerous (even for a 30-something year old full bodied adult male).
