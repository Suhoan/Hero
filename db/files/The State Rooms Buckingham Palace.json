Not too many rooms included, it is nonetheless worth seeing (plus the fact that you are actually inside Buckingham Palace!!!) - rooms open are mostly the main ones where the monarch entertains diplomats, prime ministers, other heads of state, commonwealth reps, privy council; eg. grand hall, quadrangle 'behind' the frontage of Buckingham Palace that everyone sees from the outside, dining room, painting gallery, music room, ball room, etc and the gardens where the monarch invites thousands to private garden parties. Note: Photos not permitted inside; only when you finish the tour and come out to the gardens and the cafe (no walking on the grounds either)! Cafe has sandwiches, cakes, scones and clotted cream, coffee, tea etc. Public toilets are also located near here at the end of the tour route.
