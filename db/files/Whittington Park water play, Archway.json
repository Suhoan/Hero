It's a couple of minutes' walk from Upper Holloway, making it so convenient if you're getting a train soon.\n2. The playground is great, with so many great things to play on, but also just a nice place to sit and eat lunch, as it has great shade but also places to sit in the sun.\n3. It has a fantastic outdoor gym, which loads of machines, which can save you money going to an indoor gym and it's so fun to play on the machines too.\n4. It also has a skatepark, which is a great place to practise on your skateboard, and it may be fun if you have a small scooter, but I strongly don't recommend it for bikes!!\n5. It also has 2 good sized fields for dogs to run around in, making it a great place for dogs to be as it has separate places for kids and dogs, which I think was a very good decision, as many people might not want to have their kids running around with dogs, and some dog owners might want some separate space for their dog to just be.\n\nMy only complaint about this park is it's lack of good toilet infrastructure. There's one toilet in the building, but it has a faulty light. I think the council should put in some proper public toilets.\n\nOverall, this park has something for everyone. Whether you just wanna get some exercise, or you want a nice spot to have lunch, or you want to walk your dog or run around, this park has it. Still 5 stars.","time":1690727656,"translated":false},{"author_name":"B'Leo Academy","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117421596711493798504/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU1MOOs_9TgyXHMfo6NoUXdupf7uxmbq2yqEeqDoD--7q1Z=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"When I come here alway see the playground clean and good environmental, I would recommend B'leo SMP@PMUA person visiting here, get fit","time":1694471235,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Emma Smith","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105014238859297044776/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXTHNBw_Gwfn4wW5yIYbKxBvE-98VkD0VJf9EUQubzJQuiP=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":3,"relative_time_description":"5 months ago","text":"Great park but water features not working.
