And the important contribution of Jews to British life. An essential part of the solero of British life history.\nThe Holocaust is narrated through the eyes of a British Jew who found himself and his wife caught up in the madness of antisemitism.

The top floor is currently dedicated to the artistic work of Charlotte Salomon describing her life through a chronological set of paintings.\nThe 2nd floor is devoted to the history and culture associated with Jewish settlement in England and is the core of this museum. It also houses a section on the holocaust.\nOn the first floor you have all the beautiful Jewish religious artifacts, many focused on the Torah, the holy book.","time":1577138815,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Alison Petrou","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112467984777532752969/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXLSKAvP2Q5KrF62pXkjXYQawSN5_IaI1cHinNG-M1RVQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"4 months ago","text":"A lovely museum .
