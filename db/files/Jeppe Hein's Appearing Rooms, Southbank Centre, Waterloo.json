There is always something happening here. Whether it is classical, folk or jazz, it can be found here throughout the year. In November it is one of the venues for London Jazz Month. During the summer there is always free music at hand. In front of the venue is the Thames River. There are many places to eat nearby, including an international food pop up stands on the weekend. The London Eye is only 100 metres away. There is a small skateboard park, and the occasional pop up book fairs. One of the closest tube stations is Westminster, or Waterloo. On a summer night visit the Centre and then walk along the South Bank. Lovely. Tickets to the the shows are very reasonable.","time":1687108433,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Vanessa and Jordan","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110645506319785402198/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIS1Y1gCxu1Q63-H2cFtkDGN-zhfFI3AIpnobAqCM0r=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"3 months ago","text":"For an amazing family day out, Southbank Centre takes the crown.
