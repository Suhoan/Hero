Two of the three regular play workers have recently left.  They were a fantastic team but, without being able to use the indoor facilities (due to Covid) and with kids becoming increasingly desocialized after a year without normal activities, it's no longer a safe, happy place to leave children.  This is not the fault of the play workers, but they are not currently able to offer activities that can keep young minds occupied and out of trouble.  My kid used to love Cape - it was her third space after home and school - now she finds it boring and says the new play leader is angry and rude.","time":1613900044,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Julia Cawley","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113033138995270142049/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIQv0kfCjO8LcKixkgXt8vYuUlSMxgFySKrwnD-l0-D=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 years ago","text":"Outstanding!\nA wonderful place where the children are free to enjoy the outdoors.
