the kids pool is decent and the instructor Ash is amazing (Friday mornings), in fact he is the only reason i keep using this facilty. The cleanliness of the women's changing rooms really lets it down, it's grimy with hair, gum and used plasters on the floors and in the family changing room. Crumbs and dirt from shoes everywhere so definitely take sandals and the showers are very uncomfortable and dangerous to take a baby into. It's not large enough and you cannot rest items anywhere. My husband can't take our son swimming on his own because there is no family changing room in the men's changing area. Very disappointing for a gym that had a massive makeover.","time":1699223753,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Alex Atkin","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105336374624383305547/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLBoHgcYpiVggY_LUao88dPX315EO4c-p7civQ6QRDX=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":2,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"This pool used to be great when the kids were younger but not so much now. Very dirty changing rooms. Smell very bad and floors are filthy. When leaving changing rooms to enter pool area needs a good wash.

Their evident indifference suggests they're unconcerned about members cancelling due to their poor service. Additionally, the cleanliness of the facility is concerning. I urge you to inspect the changing rooms to see for yourself. It's disappointing to see that after the extensive refurbishments following the fire, the staff seem to be diminishing its value. This has led me to cancel my membership.\n\nImmediate action is required.
