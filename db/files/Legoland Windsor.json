He and us absolutely loved it. So much to do and we went on all the rides we wanted to go on together. We stayed over and got a good deal on the room. We enjoyed the room too.\nOnly down side was the price for food in the restaurants on site. Lunch was well overpriced for what it was, and quality wasn't the best, same with evening meal only saving grace was good service and friendly staff. The park itself was amazing, though, and all the rides were appropriate, which you don't always get elsewhere. The Christmas activities on and santa visit were really good and my son again enjoyed this. We'll be back but won't be eating on site.","time":1701119318,"translated":false},{"author_name":"nilesh palkari","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115769278868420809932/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUWgaihKeKxEokvljv-O48TIrRyY1N7sgUeuiOXfHyWslY=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"If you or your kids love Lego then Legoland is must go place for you. We enjoyed our first visit very much. But was disappointed with the crowed management, it took at least 1 hour in the queue for each ride, due to the huge crowd. Few tips from my end which will be helpful if you are visiting the Legoland.\n1. Try to use public transportation to reach the Legoland. Will be helpful to avoid parking and traffic bottlenecks.\n2. Always book the tickets in advance because if you go for ticket booking for today the ticket charges will be more.\n3. Download the Legoland map on the phone to traverse through more easily in the park.\n4. Identify the rides you want to do and go directly to them without wasting time on anywhere else. The other parts of the park you can always visit without the queue.\n5. Leave half or one hour early of park closure time to avoid traffic.\n6. Avoid bank holiday weekends to avoid crowds.\n\nWas disappointed by crowd management, the Legoland Management should limit the tickets instead of asking people to go for skip the queue tickets.","time":1698540550,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Amy L.","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113049354575573232975/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXX1HQ6ZWClmLT5TzDkGDtZtNYET366nbHK4S4lM2OiA_zC=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"a week ago","text":"It's a great place.

We visited during October half term and which was very good timing as been from Yorkshire, it was not half term in Windsor which meant less people in the park! The buffet restaurant was very expensive, cost around £60 for all 3 of us and the offering was not worth the money, the picture is what my little boy ended up with on his plate, not a lot!! Would take our own food if we visited again. The app is very handy for finding your way around and also making a list of the rides you want to go on and it has the queue times on there too. Really really great place, my son did not want to leave and I would highly recommend this place for young families.","time":1700397308,"translated":false},{"author_name":"GEORGIOS ADAMAKOS","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104102462060139699541/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXcVUYegAuZfMEAz78zDN0Kf4ZKCv5YqKOq2NnKyWo36cc=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"Brilliant day out.
