However, ¬£7.50 (plus ¬£2 entry for the adult) feels a bit steep for a child under 2 considering that the play area intended for 0-2 year-olds is quite small and doesn't have much in it and also had boisterous older kids playing in it so it wasn't really safe for my cousin's 1-and-a-half year-old to play in. 5 months also seems very young to have to pay full price for. I was there with my baby who is under 5 months (we went there so my cousin's little boy could play, not mine) so only had to pay entry for myself, but had he been just over 5 months and I had had to pay for him I would have been pretty unimpressed - he may not even be able to sit up by 5 months, let alone safely play in the soft play.","time":1698978962,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Shirley D Philogene","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116183748852413274745/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXK5bCr0Nm6bgzmZT3oumif9eX6vxe-tt7GCQRtVO8ECeMZ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"My very 1st time coming here today with my family.
