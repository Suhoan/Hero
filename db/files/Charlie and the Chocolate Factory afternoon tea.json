A small melted pot to dip some marshmallows in, would possibly be an idea but there was no chocolate sadly.\n\nThe atmosphere was not entertaining at all and very disappointing. You would expect to have an aroma of something that would relate to the book/movie but there was nothing. The decor had no relation to the Charlie chocolate theme and overall I do not agree it should be called this if there is nothing in relation to it. For Â£70 per person, we expected a better atmosphere in relation to the theme.\n\nHowever the staff were amazing. Catered for our difficult needs of allergies and vegetarian options. Very friendly and attentive.\n\nWould not return unless they made it more like the theme of a chocolate factory. But overall an ok experience.","time":1700554421,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Leah Suter","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100520540458356031770/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVzLpRZN4o1o8WuXqQGhnDC8Dq0bdWuk9KgXPZAic6G-w=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"I cannot explain how wonderful our experience was here! I have a gluten and dairy allergy. They were one of only 3 places I found in London that could accommodate both allergies. They made sure I had everything my family had and I wasnâ€™t shorted anything. The service was incredible. The foodâ€¦.was incredible! We went to the Max Hatter tea the day before and it was awful for me. No scones, no substitutes. They gave me a vegan menu instead of just dairy free. None of these mixups happened here. I got to try my first scone and it was DELICIOUS! The pineapple spread that comes with the scones is out of this world. Try it even if you donâ€™t think you like pineapples. It was one of the favorite things I had there ðŸ˜… Everything was honestly out of this world. I donâ€™t even care for salmon either and the salmon was incredible. They offered us seconds as well before they brought out the next course. They kept the tea flowing. I had a different idea of what weâ€™d experience based on pictures (I thought weâ€™d have really crazy drinks and food with like smoking hot chocolate etc) but this was still an absolute delight. I am so grateful that my dietary needs were able to be accommodated with no issues or mix ups and I got exactly the same amount of food and type of food as everyone else.
