She loved it so much she insisted I take her back the following day! yes the equipment is well worn but this is from high volume use of children playing freely and enjoying themselves. The staff only met my daughter for one day and they  recognised her, and engaged her in a range of activities as she had no established friendship group at the playground. The staff were incredibly welcoming and gave me full feedback on what my daughter had been doing. I felt assured that she was safe and well cared for. My daughter came back singing new songs, holding her art project, telling me about her adventures and demanding to go again at half term.
