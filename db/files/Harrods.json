Impressing royal architecture and design. Reminded me KaDeWe in Berlin because of similar food hall concept. It can feel a little tight, but maybe it is just too full of luxury stores and goods for every need. Still difficult to get classy models as they might be gone quick because of crowds. We were shopping at the Dior and took for us a while until employee gave us what we wanted. Cute gift shop downstairs was full of nice souvenirs, average price is 17-19 pounds per piece + they charge for a bag so ask price first at the cashier. Long lines of course. It was worth a visit, although I could not get what I was looking for, but my favorite shopping center is Dubai Mall so far.","time":1700742470,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Amazon Islinger","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114084898755216180272/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWWAuqbXpBUIvjjksCzaHh7nul4wiVCtwmsTCty4anLZxE=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"a week ago","text":"Came here to try out fragrances and was not disappointed! Incredible selection for any fragrance collector looking to try out new scents.
