A full 360 view of London, the tallest building with a viewing platform.\n\nThe shard also has three restaurants in it that you can RSVP. I highly recommend it.\n\nEven if you’re not down to eat at any of the restaurants at the very top You can RSVP a small table and get cocktails, snacks, desserts, pastries, and more.\n\nIn the evening they will also have performance artist like a singer or pianist.\n\nMy boyfriend and I stayed up there for a few hours.

It feels like some cheap (even though the prices are high) tourist trap.\nWe got our coffees from the lower bar, walked up the flights of stairs and drunk our coffees in the bar at the top, but again- with nowhere to sit it just doesn’t feel like it’s a very welcoming place, which is such a shame and a missed opportunity in my opinion.\nIt’d have been so beautiful if they had some decent mixed drinks/cocktails and perhaps warm cocktails, mead, hot cider upstairs… also some half decent music… but it seems it’s much more important for them to get a high volume of people in and out, fast ;)","time":1701040123,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Sushmitha V","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106852591259890030180/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXPDLvuTupGp_QvbmN2msJxewqDUwCK8MZoZ2eTvfTklbi1=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a week ago","text":"The View from The Shard in London is simply breathtaking.
