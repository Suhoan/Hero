Greeted with a warm welcome by the lady on the desk, clean and modern changing rooms inside and out, warm showers and a spotlessly clean pool in beautiful surroundings. Enough room poolside to relax for a bit if you want to as well and even though I went on a hot day when it was busy, it never felt too crowded. It also showed a true cross-section of society and was clearly being used by locals, with people of all ages, genders and races, which was super refreshing and gave a wonderful vibe.

A few minor quibbles. Wish people weren't permitted to sit on the edge of the entire length of the pool in the slowest lane with their legs in the water. I need to swim in this lane as not a strong swimmer. I have to take a break at the side during a length & can't when people are sitting here (I don't want to have to come very early or late to avoid this). Also, wish staff were more proactive in checking toilet paper supplies in the ladies'. There was no toilet paper in any of the cubicles.","time":1694175902,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Beatriz Casarrubios","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112946046608465651675/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX3oVSwjppAq1vparwOuLrUBZDh3Mj-a8cPPD3yjXc4Ao8=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"Love this place, being coming here twice a week for the last couple of months and itâ€™s my favourite.
