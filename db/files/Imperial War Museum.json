After a massive remodeling of the property, we now have an incredible and  very accessible museum for all ages and groups.\n\nSpread over several floors, there activities for all ages and abilities.\n\nThe staff and volunteers are brilliant at explaining and guiding visitors around the exhibitions. We visited while the Holocaust exhibition was running and the ream explained with great care about the content and age appropriate nature of the exhibit.\n\nThere are a ton of interactive exhibits, with the new collections for the first, second world wars being a stand out.\n\nCredit must also go to the work and effort explaining the Irish troubles and good Friday agreement.\n\nThe surrounding park is also a great thing if you need to let little people expand some energy beforehand.\n\nMy only gripe would be some of the prices in the Cafe, but again a great team and brilliant layout.","time":1700390312,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Helen Darbyshire","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108353772352976082298/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV9CySeLBO1PhzdGiAtk1llgrm5NLzsxa_8MMRo8ttjEE1u=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a week ago","text":"One of the best museums I’ve been to.
