It offers a 360 view over the central area of London - it is close to the river just by the London Bridge. You can see many of the cities attractions from up top.\nTo get up you have to climb approximately 320 stairs, which is no easy feat.\n\nHighly recommended in the morning when there's not a long waiting time, since the tower is quite small, there's a limited amount of people allowed in at a given time.\n\nIf you plan to visit the Tower Bridge, the receipt from this offers you a 20% discount, so plan accordingly.","time":1689754730,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Alexya P.","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111321436894820554736/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVm8prxg6DtbSYq7I_lIJYkNHJ2o6Sb-GSXO83FsQlkARU=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"It.s a nice experience to walk upstairs.. you'll get a certificate at the end saying that you walked 311 steps!
