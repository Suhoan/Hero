It's full of bright lights and small shops that look very pretty. You can smell sweet and spicy things like hot wine and gingerbread. There's also happy music and people laughing. You can buy special handmade gifts and try different kinds of tasty food. There are fun things to do too. It might be a bit crowded, but it's really fun and makes you feel the Christmas spirit. It's a great place to visit if you love Christmas.","time":1701030048,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Nahshon","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117146047820211346341/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocITecl9zBKwJpLTNsdPz5Zhla-3v-XiC2-K0RbDUtQvWw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":3,"relative_time_description":"in the last week","text":"It’s a very lovely Christmas market. Just be reminded that the market is very short. It’s not very massive, so don’t expect to spend too much time there. It is also very crowded, and to some extent, you will be pushed towards the centre of the lane away from the shops as the queues prevent you from going close to the stalls.
