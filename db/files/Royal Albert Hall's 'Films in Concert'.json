I've been here many times to watch movies with a live orchestra (Back to the Future, The Godfather, etc) and other performances. They have many events that take place. I would recommend signing up to their subscription list to see what tickles your fancy. As mentioned above, there's movies, music, and all types of other shows.\n\nThe staff here will greet you with a smile and are very friendly. There is a bar inside, but it's limited to snacks and drinks. We went to see 'an evening with Arnold Schwarzenegger', and it was tremendous. The auditorium held 4000 people, and it was amazing.  We took public transport to get there, and it's a few minutes' walk from South Kensington tube station. However, you can drive, and there is parking nearby (you have to pay). If watching an even performance, I'd recommend grabbing a bite beforehand near South Kensington before heading to the venue.
