Close to Acton Town Station (District and Piccadilly Lines). On leaving the station turn LEFT to cross the road via a Zebra (Pedestrian) Crossing, so much safer as the road gets very busy. Once across the road, turn right and at the end of the bridge turn left into Museum Way. 200 yards brings you to the entrance. Admission is ¬£ 12.50 for Adults (cheaper for local residents). Pre-booking is suggested but walk-ins are also possible. During Open Days it is open 1000 - 1800 (and the Cafe is open 1000 - 1700). Once inside the area is divided into two parts - Trains and Buses. Lots to see and memories to be evoked. Very much worth doing.\nPlease note that this site is only open a few times a year so please check before travelling. The main Museum site in Covent Garden is open more frequently.","time":1695398840,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Hello Ness","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110298550597651620425/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXClofYY1DYyt0caygx15_2LESMyRjl7EkT5Ftm44DGvo8=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba8","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"A huge collection of London Transport memorabilia, rolling stock and collection through the different periods and decades that are not on displayed at the main museum in Covent Garden.
