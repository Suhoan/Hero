Really pleasant place to walk through and love the way it contrasts so much to the glass and concrete skyscrapers surrounding it. The evening lights add to the atmosphere, as do all the people enjoying themselves away from the rush and noise of the surrounding road network. Good for dog walkers, anyone living in the nearby apartments who wants to have the pleasure of some natural surroundings and visitors like ourselves to sit and enjoy a picnic on the grassed areas watching the world go by. Happy to have found this little gem of a place and will visit again when next at Elephant & Castle.","time":1580854909,"translated":false},{"author_name":"jeff benjamin","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107996399073453985103/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXNW2Vm42t0pA7aGYf-lAoR--Vafl0RPYRF4pf_JUGbOAWy=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba7","rating":3,"relative_time_description":"2 years ago","text":"A regenerated grassed area with small playground, and fountain that’s unfortunately smothered by the surrounding hedge.\nLandscaped and maintained to a good standard, under the gaze of a formidable high-rise building.\nSome puzzling round decorative balls about to come adrift of their moorings perhaps “artistic” markers/reminders of the former churchyard.","time":1607445909,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Fabio Basile (Osteopath)","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116345677970173938632/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV7cV2IdLOtyprt8SLMuP_gnJrytbEoloZZdOjpxuWYIAJy=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"9 months ago","text":"I've almost been attacked by a suspicious guy once and I also saw someone stealing a bike a few steps from me.
