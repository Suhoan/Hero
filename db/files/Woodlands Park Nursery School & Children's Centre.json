I\nSent 2 of my kids there and it was horrible; I run away.  The workers are miserable never says hi or help you. If you ask how the day went they abruptly tell you to read their diary to find out. To say the least they do not cater to your child needs if you are of a certain status. Not community feel at all and not as diverse and inclusive. Avoid avoid avoid. There are many other places were workers are highly qualified and motivated in looking after your child.","time":1658782329,"translated":false},{"author_name":"S J","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117882841413382036147/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIMSZ-R9Wqhye-8Yf_8-_Mh7t_hPPgrdQxd_Byb6B_S=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"4 years ago","text":"I have used Woodlands Park since I was pregnant with my 1st daughter for midwife appointments, baby weighing.
