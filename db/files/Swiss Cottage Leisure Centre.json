I’ve been member since 2015 and I love this gym. It’s very spacious, 3 floors, all glass windows and there is an amazing pool with all glass windows so you basically can see outside the park and the beautiful threes. The gym has many different studios for classes, a large hall for different type of sports, and the gym floor is very large and spacious. They also have the Spa, with the steam rooms and sauna and if you want to get any other treatments. This has always been my home gym for ages.

Someone please need to report it or I’m thinking of doing so, because when it comes to health and safety this particular soft play centre is filthy and it’s actually dangerous for children and toddlers. My son couldn’t stop coughing inside because of the dust it was disgusting!! We lasted 10 mins and then we left. The dust on the mats was so thick I couldn’t believe it. Shame on you for not looking after a place where toddlers visit and play as if it’s not important. How can this be allowed?? Please don’t take your children there!! Where’s management?? This issue needs to be submitted to the head office and I will make sure it does.","time":1699103116,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Ikram Casi","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112141168624537172508/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocL6kXwopsXj3A9ZcHLusSuDYsdIleTK_JZtaL_8ZqZ1=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"I had paid for an only woman “teaching” swimming session and as other women were undressed in the locker room, a group of men had walked in and there were no staff around causing confusion and frustration with the women, I had asked the women if this happens often in which they said yes to. Also, upon arrival I had double checked if I was going to be taught swimming which I was told yet. However, I had quickly realised there weren’t any teachers around when the session had started so I asked the lifeguard about it in which she told me this happens extremely often as people assume it’s a taught class due to the website stating it as an teaching swimming class. I do not know how to swim so I feel that I had wasted money to sit on the sidelines before I had decided to leave 5 minutes into the session.","time":1698077339,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Peter Smith","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101367283926551053746/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocL4oXrT5UYK6x5aY2sa7EWRytuV11f5AaFwZtLuUHX0=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":2,"relative_time_description":"3 months ago","text":"The air conditioning in the gym is almost non existant (on a warm day it's like practising hot yoga, good if you like pouring with sweat), and they play awful radio with non stop advertising.
