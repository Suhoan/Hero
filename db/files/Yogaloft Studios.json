As grandparents we ended up joining in with our 24mo old girl.\nIt all looked clean and I have no idea what is triggered when they enter but she was keen to go round and get to the slides. One slightly tricky bit, coming out of a partially clear tunnel onto a lattice of straps but with a quarter open to allow access from below, caused some nervousness that required grandparent involvement but mostly just tearing around.\nThe location is slightly off the main roads and is undistinguished. The doors are on an electric lock and the flooring as you enter the reception area is plain concrete: the industrial look (perhaps).\nThere is a reception desk and some snacks and drinks available (photos attached)â€¦.including child friendly items, such as rice cakes etc.\nWe didnâ€™t visit the yoga studio(s?) which are off to the right as you enter, heading straight ahead to the soft play studio. This has obviously been repurposed as there is a ballet bar on the wall. Sofas and settees and a few tables and chairs give viewers the chance to watch - or catch your breath between scampering after your little darlings when they want some company.\nIt was quite full when we went (Bank holiday Monday 10:00) but that made it fun for the little ones, as they could watch older children tearing around.\nEveryone was polite and with one exception (a little boy) well behaved and allowing time for others.\nI would highly recommend this as a place for young children.\n\nPRICES\nCosts were Â£7 per child and Â£3 per adult. No food allowed in the play area but otherwise you could bring your own.","time":1681201019,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Ohm Brella","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114250958255593191719/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKp2ShT6XWN9pJh24zhgT3vzfRrWtK3fxzEfZxPKhsD=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"This is my local yoga studio in London and had been the best studio in the area for iyengar for many years, and you can be sure to find high quality teaching here.
