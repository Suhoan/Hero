I shared the same problems as another reviewer when I went to see Nosferatu with a live orchestra: people laughing all the way through: even the end when it got more serious (as I know the beginning of the film was comedic so it's obviously fine laughing then).\n\nI decided to just write that off as a weird experience and booked tickets to see Halloween (1978) on Halloween night 2023. I was really excited for that one, did not think I'd have the same problems. I for sure expected audience interaction, but in a way that respects the movie and heightens the appreciation for it. However that was not the case, and Halloween was also completely ruined in exactly the same way as Nosferatu: very very disrespectful audience who didn't take the movie seriously at all, completely ruined all the suspense and atmosphere: even laughing throughout the whole final act which has absolutely zero jokes!!! Ruined the movie for me and many others I'm sure. It's a real shame because I can't fault the venue itself; the services offered are all fine, staff are nice enough, and the range of movies shown is really broad: definitely does its job as a unique cinema to see classic films.\n\nJust a real shame that on both occasions the audience behaved in this way: quite surprised really as I thought this kind of cinema would attract fans of the movies who would want to enjoy them etc. Really can't stress how both viewings the movie was completely ruined for me and those I went with. So if you are the kind of person who likes a quiet cinema to take a classic movie seriously, I would strongly recommend you think twice before booking tickets here. Perhaps the cinema could look into ways to discourage this kind of behaviour for certain films.\n\nSorry I couldn't be more positive but that's just how it went. From now on I will be avoiding seeing any kind of serious/suspenseful movie here.","time":1698929697,"translated":false},{"author_name":"R.
