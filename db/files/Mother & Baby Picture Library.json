From when you open their doors you'll step into a very traditional Persian style atmosphere. The waiter greeted us very nicely and explained to us the dishes on the menu. The portions are quite generous compared to other local restaurants so order cautiously unless you've skipped lunch and tucking into dinner & quite hungry. We ordered humous, yogurts, bread, soup, meat platter, salad (not realising that they give you a gigantic bowl of salad as complimentary). It was all delicious. I expected the rice to be some what seasoned but it was just plain rice but they give you a big portion.

Compared to other restaurants, it's bowl was significantly bigger! We had \"Kashk-e-Bademjoon\" containing walnut, onion, aubergine & kashk. It tasted delicious. However, bear in mind that you need to order bread separately for this dish.\nMain: we ordered \"Kebab makhsous\". It tastes good. The tender fillet kebab tasted delicious. Also, we ordered \"Shivid baghali ba mahiche\". The mahicheh (shank) was a lot, one person can not definitely finish it. However, its taste was not good.
