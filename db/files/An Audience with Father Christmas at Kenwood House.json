It only took my family about 30mins even with use taking photos to finish the trail. We live far and was looking forward to this, just got a little disappointed with the amount of displays they had. It's not to crowded compared to kew gardens which can be a bonus.

Everything about this place was misleading. The trail is definitely not one hour, there really isn’t much to it. £2.50 for one Marshmallow to burn over a small crowded camp fire. The website states there is no nearby parking- however you can park right outside the park on the main road (no parking restrictions). Very limited food options there were only three food stalls, and please don’t waste your time trying to find a seat in the cramped hall. “Breathtaking Light Trail” the only thing breathtaking was how cold it was. It’s far too cold to waste money and time, disappointed.","time":1671232099,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Paula Lopez Pallas","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103570895709231673550/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKZWiSP4UNzWkb0eC-0jqpxRuKto0gZJwESW4UZ_C5x=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"11 months ago","text":"A thoroughly enjoyable experience.
