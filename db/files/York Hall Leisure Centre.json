Spa only has sauna and steam room which have very similar effect and cold pool. Unlikely that you are going to spend more than 45 mins there. The gym is ok but not very equipped. There is no place where to leave your belonging unless you have a 1 pound coin and want to go on the top floor. Receptionist not helpful. You ask for questions about the memberships and she says ‘its all online’ and questions you rather than help you. I booked a yoga class and I had to leave because 15 mins have passed and did not start. Then a angry men that was supposed to be the teacher maybe? Came inside without greeting.
