running water.\nIt's calming and fun for all.\nCalming in the sense of lack of bold colours you get in most water places, with loads of grass and to sit down and enjoy a picnic.\nBins are located outside for all rubbish which is great for emptying out your lunch once you've finished.\n\nThe water flows in a circular pattern which offers different types of water plays, bubbles from under the feet, rapids whriling this way then that to trail on, steps one side with water rushing, deeper part, that children swim in (5ft3, above knee slightly)\"rock climbing\" with patterned rocks on the floor to climb up while the water rushes down them.\n\nWe spent a good amount of time here but you could easily spend all day with the family having fun!...","time":1692706047,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Chelsea","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101728204282138382239/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXDL9xbugJaICljgbWiqRDltpJsf79Bw-gJLi5H29Ui09KL=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"5

Since I been small I’ve always been interested in her and admired what a wonderful human she is. When I had the opportunity in May to visit London, it was on my list of places that I wanted to go to. The memorial is so beautiful and I sat there for more than 2 hours just enjoying the space. The fountain is so unique and special. It look like a lazy river but it actually flows into each other and not in a circle. The fountain itself has different textures within the walls. This place was absolutely beautiful and I highly recommend you coming if you stop at Hyde park!","time":1686642724,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Flash P","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117690256633294526513/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKVsk_KxGziiX-43KQvEvQvglZ5K-W42m9uWck-8b5S=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"First time here.

Without spoiling it for anyone, the circular water course has lots of quite different sections for you to paddle through and keeps you wondering and guessing, it's really incredibly mindful! If you do not remove your shoes and have a paddle, you won't get it. We walked a few miles that day and cooling our feet for 30 mins was just bliss.  A really fitting memorial for Diana who would have loved to see kids and parents splashing around and having a great time - all for free too. We went from St James Park Station, through St James Park to Buckingham Palace, through Green Park to Hyde's Park Corner and through this Park to the fountain. Lovely walk taking in 3 of the royal parks and some great landmarks along the way.","time":1693865241,"translated":false}],"user_ratings_total":9283,"website":"https://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/hyde-park/things-to-see-and-do/memorials,-fountains-and-statues/diana-memorial-fountain/"},"status":"OK","place_id":"ChIJD7QNyUkFdkgRaFifHe2LImI","address":"W Carriage Dr, London W2 2UH, United Kingdom","categories":["water play"]}
