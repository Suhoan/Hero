In a mostly good way but there is a vibe of saying yes to every idea resulting in a mish-mash.\n\nFirstly it feels very overlooked by office buildings, a large high-rise, rear of high street businesses and the looming church. The latter is well addresses with surprisingly large pine trees, while the businesses had people taking their smoking break in the park.\n\nA park in the heart of Clerkenwell but hard to access from the high street unless you know it‚Äôs there. There‚Äôs a tiny entrance on the Western edge and you have to have maps open to realise there‚Äôs a park.\n\nIt does have a ton of seating, nicely secluded and ideal for lunch as many others have mentioned. They‚Äôre in themes areas, like the pine forest, vines, along the side of the main grass, down the side of the multisports area and more.\n\nThe central grass has fancy metal ‚Äòno dogs‚Äô signs for the central area that are blatantly ignored. For ‚Äòreasons‚Äô there are some bumpy bits ‚Ä¶ my kids loved them. There‚Äôs even one between the kids swing and exercise area which makes you wonder what‚Äôs buried under there.\n\nThe exercise area is good, though there are some dirty concrete seats (for viewing?!), a tiny basketball area for practice shots ‚Ä¶ next to the tennis/football/basketball court.\n\nSome bits don‚Äôt really make sense, like how many different types of concrete wall you can have (thin, thick, wavy); why the table tennis is under the pine trees (perfect space to lose balls); random other bumps and lumps. But it‚Äôs definitely got character!\n\nThe funky building in the middle makes you hope it‚Äôs a cafe or toilet ‚Ä¶ sorry, but it‚Äôs a park office. Though it does have some picnic benches in front of it.\n\nThe park also continues round to the East and South but you sort of have to go through the kids playground first. A longer meadow-like space flanked with flowers.","time":1678725351,"translated":false},{"author_name":"OLAWA MABS","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111226368496366826260/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKng4SL5l5nluSFLBZ90SFhNhnswxoAIG9gJkxp1fRd=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"7 months ago","text":"Went there for a festival.
