First time here with my husband and 3 small children, and ALL of us were totally WOW'd! Fantastic team providing welcoming and fun services across all the activities, facilities were convenient, the control of capacity was brilliant throughout the timed sessions, although the water kept coming on and off alot on the splash ground so, unsure whether that was intentional or not. Speaker quality wasn't great, having music helped create a vibe and atmosphere but it appeared to be connected via a poor Bluetooth connection as that kept cutting out too. Anyway, despite these couple things, it was still fantastic. Such a fabulous park providing creative activities for families, an all in one patch of endless fun. The best part of it all was that the Bounsea was located right behind the splash park, with the unicorn boat rides besides that, and a great playground in the middle of it all. A PERFECT day out for families with such value for money on the pricing of everything! üëè we are very impressed parents who believe this is massively a hidden gem in London!

We didn‚Äôt go in the enormous bouncy castle obstacle course, but that looked really good from outside, too.
