My two granddaughters were in fits of laughter from the moment it started. The two actors were both brilliant. The portrayal of George was an absolute joy in its attention to detail and the  comedy. I loved that the production was so interactive and inclusive. We have two profoundly deaf family members ( who did not attend but we are a very deaf aware family) and I was pleased tell them that the performance was so inclusive; this lmeant a lot to us. I loved that it was so visual and that sign supported English was used. We felt so involved as the audience. The fact that the children also joined in and  ‚Äòplayed‚Äô with the rubbish ( the silver sheet passed up and down the auditorium) and throwing the red balls at each other at the end thrilled my granddaughters (aged five and three). The performance was an absolute delight in every way. My husband and myself also enjoyed the performance (as much as the children I believe üòä) and we delighted in their joy.
