The staff were beyond providers of childcare, they were supportive of my wife and I as parents and supported us when one of our daughters had some challenging relationships with other children in the centre.\n\nThe Centre has really moved forward over the years expanding its offer to include Forest School and holiday clubs. The setting is perfect with the playground bordering the river and the Hackney marshes and short walk over the bridge. The children chanting \"Hello, hello\" to passing boats will stay with me for a very long time.\n\nWe have maintained a close relationship with staff there and recently visited only to be warmly welcomed.","time":1548172445,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Sarah H","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116280677182533854009/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVz0gadcl2jhU5UgdnuNozXhvVHm-ISydunpl3RPHL88qet=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":3,"relative_time_description":"6 years ago","text":"Lovely, helpful staff. They were in the middle of a well organised fire drill when I arrived and they were very attentive to all the kids. Messy toilets and baby changing area had loads of stuff on top of them  (rubbish bags?). I had a 4year old chuck a toy at my 6month old daughter during the stay and play and she wasn't corrected by anyone although 2 adults witnessed it. Not sure if the adults were staff or not but the toy hit my daughter on her first (and only) session at this centre. I know kids do this sometimes but it would have been nice to have another adult take responsibility and point out her behaviour wasn't appropriate. There weren't other babies her age to play with unfortunately so we were a bit left out. The doors to exit (including the front gate) are pretty easy to push open all the way from the play area so I'd be nervous a kid could escape?","time":1500674827,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Dimple","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105573524730549274094/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKd7mSjsoTYM-zS5Kc7d6J78LAcmE96AX4PpJJ5iEsY=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"4 years ago","text":"my child likes clapton park nursery i found it very useful and support my child alot and they understand so well how my daughter is she will miss this place it such amazying place staffs are very helpful,  kind, care... we will miss neilum and denise alot","time":1549676792,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Mimi A","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104912829978929269631/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVrXQ-VNlBDbjIPRxPtv0xWnIYnuSmbB5CdEWjeHiHwECrQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"4 years ago","text":"Great stay and play session with Johanna","time":1549110394,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Lynx Nephireé Kai","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105076671193097996257/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWzbeDCY89YX-HYUAFuO2Few-k0y1W3oLqL_ii2lxwL6_c=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":3,"relative_time_description":"6 years ago","text":"Great helpful staff.
