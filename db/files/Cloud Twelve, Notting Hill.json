My mum, sister and I recently had the pleasure of visiting this spa for a day of pampering and relaxation, and I must say, it was an experience beyond compare. From the moment we stepped through the door, we was greeted with warmth and genuine hospitality. The exceptional level of customer service displayed by all staff truly set this spa apart.\n\nEvery interaction we had at this establishment was a delight. The staff members were incredibly attentive, catering to our every need with a smile. They went above and beyond, ensuring our comfort and satisfaction throughout our visit. It was evident that their main goal was to create a serene and enjoyable experience for their customers, and they exceeded expectations in every way.\n\nWhat truly stood out was the friendliness of the staff. It felt like spending a day with close friends rather than simply receiving spa services. They were approachable and their expertise and genuine care added an extra layer of comfort, allowing us to fully relax and enjoy our spa day.\n\nThe treatment I received from Carol was heavenly.  I left feeling rejuvenated, refreshed, and utterly pampered.\n\nOverall, my experience at this spa surpassed all expectations. The outstanding customer service combined with the attentiveness and friendliness of the staff created an unforgettable experience. I wholeheartedly recommend this spa to anyone in search of a truly blissful escape. Treat yourself, and allow this oasis of tranquility to whisk you away into a world of relaxation and indulgence.","time":1700996175,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Miss Christian","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114503025386763266425/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXAq0AyVllVS2vVf_x8GPGU7xE-QZAg8P2xKrquxhbtJWw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a week ago","text":"Excellent customer service.

We had a tour of the place and facilities with Sven who was friendly and informative. There’s an abundance of things in the Kids Club to help children learn, play and develop.

All the staff were lovely, Karen took especially good care and went out of her way for us. The facilities were enjoyable- steam room, sauna, salt room & meditation room. The food was also delicious! I was disappointed with the massage itself and felt my therapist rushed, for the price I paid I would expect a full hour (my massage was ended 10 minutes earlier than what I paid for). I wasn’t given a choice of oils to choose from which my friends were given for their massages. Having had many massages in different places, I wouldn’t say this was my most enjoyable. I also didn’t enjoy the fact that I had cold oil being poured on me (perhaps warming in the masseuse hands or having an oil warmer would be good) as well as a clunking noise from the sink for a good part of my massage made it all less relaxing. Would go again, in the hopes of a better massage which isn’t cut short and more attention given to my therapy.","time":1694334340,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Mia Maugé","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107612850397679477621/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXR4o9Cqel1XNwbbpcl0bA3a6KBug6cnuNIcrzCShM7mylJ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 weeks ago","text":"A warm welcome by the lovely staff, then a chilled time in the cosy spa area with steam room, sauna. salt room and a meditation suite… then the dreamiest full body massage had me floating on leaving Cloud Twelve this afternoon.
