But then I went to the 'other' ladies' loos instead of the signposted ones (avoids the inevitable huge queues for the ladies)\nAs soon as you see the signs for the ladies loos next to the bar, keep walking through the doors so you're directly in front of the staircase out, and to your left there's a staircase down and there are men & women's toilets and a bar. On the way down, have a look at the portraits of stars who've performed there; it seems to be a rite of passage for most well-known stars.\n\nThere's also a bar directly outside the auditorium and 2 inside the auditorium.\n\nSat with a friend in I 16 and I 17 and had a perfect view; straight in the eyeline of Ben Willbond/Larry Rickard from Horrible Histories/Yonderland/Ghosts, & later Bridget Christie, at the RHLSTP (Richaed Herring's Leicester Square Theatre Podcast) podcast. Next time, if I can, I'll sit in 16/17 but a couple rows ahead. But all views are good.\n\nEven during the interval when I went to the auditorium bar I saw the view from the bar stools (with the stage set up for Bridget's podcast - they film 2 podcasts in one day)  which was perfect, if a little far away. It's a small 400-seat theatre, so every seat will be good (apart from the couple in front of speakers right at the front).\n\nBen and Larry and Bridget Christie were so lovely, spending likely hours meeting the 400 fans queueing outside (the show finished at 10pm, I left at about 10:50pm and I was quite early on in the queue. Thr queue ended up going all the way down the street). Gutted to miss Bridget, but I got to meet Ben & Larry (15 years in the making since I grew up watching Horrible Histories, as did a lot of people there), and they were so lovely, I managed to make Larry laugh & even got a hug from Ben  üòç","time":1689021571,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Susie Leventis","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112725766096694935017/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKZDegr090FKX0nLrY9KMVyTxgsPz6fYYZSAH0AtzB3=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"Lovely Saturday night.
