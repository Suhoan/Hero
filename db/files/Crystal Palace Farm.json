It was very quiet during our visit on a Thursday around noon. The whole farm is buggy accessible and easy to navigate. We parked our buggy by the gate with no issues. My two year old loved the Shetland Ponies and lambs. On the upper level you’ll find the small furries. We saw a gorgeous black cat, rabbits, Guinea pigs and a tortoise munching on some lettuce. The wash trough is set low enough for toddlers to reach. There’s a box to leave a donation with no pressure.","time":1687440757,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Justin Gillett","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104040018737112023538/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX8D8bL2qebmoO5dToWQr5nys8qcU122R3nE_QRTsvmCUc=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"5 years ago","text":"Not my favourite city farm by far - it's all concrete, it can get very crowded and it's a mixed bag with the animals. It's free and accessible and the kids enjoy it for a little while - I suggest popping your head in as something to do in the park, rather than going here specifically for the animals. Toilets are not the nicest but available for all so a bonus.
