Absolutely brilliant evening here. I totally recommend that you give this a visit if you are in London. We spent the evening here and we had an absolutely fantastic time. Great food and unlimited red wine and ale. We had such a blast that we want to take friends and family next time. You are taken downstairs to what looks like old wine cellars, seated at long tables with other's and there are lots of performers to keep you entertaining throughout the evening. You can hire costumes to really get into the spirit of things. Such a wonderful experience and a great night out without breaking the bank. We will definitely return on our next visit to London. The staff were all very friendly and really in character with the whole medieval thing. Well done medieval banquet.

The actors were amazing and they're voices were incredible! Defintly one for the whole family! Finishes the night with a family disco - also drinks are very reasonably priced!

Fun to come in groups or with family especially kids, but we went as a couple and had a great time as well. If you come in a pair, they make you sit in a group which is great as everybody gets into a happy-friendly-zone here with the live music.\nYou can rent a costume for ¬£10 or buy a prop like a crown or jester hat, medieval goblet for ¬£5.\n\nWe loved the music, entertainment, and timings of food service planned very well.\n\nAbsolutely fantastic show with live singing, contorting, balancing acts, fight acts, dressed up as king, queen, jesters and whatnot from the medieval.\n\nDecent 4-course British meal including soup, salad, main and dessert.\n\nI would suggest them to provide with a spoon. They tell you to drink it directly through bowl as there were no spoons. This is silly as at the same time they also provide you with the fork and knife to eat roast chicken. Just provide a spoon, will you?\nThey could also work on welcoming the guest better. May be queue up! As they open the door, mass of people waiting to get in rush up to the door, very primitive way. May be it on purpose, but it is a bad idea when on the day when it is raining or temp is zero degree, and everybody would rush to get in.","time":1514493939,"translated":false}],"user_ratings_total":1133},"status":"OK","place_id":"ChIJjx9_y0kDdkgRMeEOnbfYFfc","categories":["historic"],"address":"Ivory House, London E1W 1BP, United Kingdom"}
