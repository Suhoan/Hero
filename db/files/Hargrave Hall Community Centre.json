of the original features including the large windows, high vaulted ceiling, and parqueting flooring. Like many old buildings which have been converted it does have few quirks as it continues to comply with the latest health and safety legislations, but we say better to have these oddities than another church turned into private accommodation!\n\nAdmittedly it does need a bit of love and care to bring it up to date. Sadly, like many others the centre was closed due to covid restrictions for nearly two years and the small charity faced reopening with less staff and limited reserves.  Though it is run by a charity the building itself is owned by Islington council who undertake the larger building maintenance, so the charity is currently waiting their turn to have the backlog of jobs completed.  However, over the past few months the management has secured funding and installed a new professional kitchen, and their caretaker is working hard painting walls and fixing the many smaller jobs he has been tasked with, so we are hopeful that in time it will shine once more.\n\nFree events like their recent Pilates and Easter arts and craft sessions and clubs like their new gardening club and kids summer holiday clubs – both starting soon, comes primarily from private hall hire and the limited funding they have managed to secure. It’s nice to know that the money from locals hiring the centre for their parties is going straight back into the community.\n\nWe have high hopes that as we return to ‘normal’ whatever that is now, and Hargrave Hall Community Centre will continue serve the community offering cheap hall hire and a wide range of free or low cost activities to all.","time":1656015129,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Peearejay Wilkinson","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101293848245537674928/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIHC-tDusYts_OFuBTe2QOaomrYOFlZFBcTd_NwTHRd=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"It is a very nice hall with a variety of different activities going on there as different people rent out the space so would have to check what is going and if one can attend as some may be private while others are come and join in.","time":1640740580,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Linda Ayanwale","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114534292778948523594/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJXJAwN8J2p5n2imNQXlfEAmIoQx9TRTKeo61ZQFZk_=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"4 years ago","text":"We booked both the upper & lower hall in July 2019 for a party in October. I paid the deposit in August and completed a signed contract. No one bothered to contact me I chased for months for a confirmation. By September Tina finally responded it took another 3 weeks for the deposit to be confirmed. I sent the same signed agreement 5 times! We had been asking to view the hall over 3 months and on the 4 occasions the hall was locked and no staff available. One week before the party we finally viewed the hall! It not the biggest hall but it is adequate. 2 days before the party Debbie explained that they had double booked us. Hargreaves NEVER mentioned any other booking before this, if they had I would have cancelled the booking. Instead of having the hall at 4pm we were told we could have the hall at 5:30pm and 6pm despite the party starting at 5pm we also needed an hour to decorate and move the furniture. I was also told by Debbie at the last minute I would lose the booking if I didn't pay the balance immediately even though I had been chasing the invoice for 3 months. Up until today I have not received any invoice. The day of the party the previous party overran and the hall wasn't adequately cleaned. No mopping whatsoever. The delay meant the hall was not decorated and the party started 2 hours late. We had family from all over the world so this was very disappointing that Hargreaves misled us. At 10:50pm Helen the caretaker asked for the music to be turned off. We did this and cleaned up as she requested. Upon requesting my deposit I was charged an extra 2 hours, even though I left 1hour later to help clean the hall despite paying extra for cleaning! The whole experience was terrible. I would not recommend, they are very disorganized and without any prior notification put extra charges last minute. They are extremely difficult to contact and ruined my party!!!!","time":1573985467,"translated":false},{"author_name":"hussain yusoof","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101339831593774862014/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVKXqmf_dIOBd2Ya_sC32O3G0kWu3MCE895D08cmlYhCq0=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"4 years ago","text":"It was a fairly large space with a back garden and had a small stage for people needing it and it also had changing rooms downstairs in the basement and it was also located very nicely as it was close to the main road as well so it was close to buttons and train stations","time":1567163265,"translated":false}],"user_ratings_total":67,"website":"https://www.hargravehall.co.uk/"},"status":"OK","place_id":"ChIJgXFP664bdkgRynmdgsPRDnU","categories":["stay and play"],"address":"Hargrave Hall, Hargrave Rd, Archway, London N19 5SP, United Kingdom"}
