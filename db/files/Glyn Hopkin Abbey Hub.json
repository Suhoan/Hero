The only good thing about it is polite receptionists: with their treacle speech they would cover mechanics backs. Firstly, you have to wait for an appointment for at least 4 weeks. Once you have booked an appointment for car diagnostics - you will not know how long they will keep your car before seeing it and sorting out the problem. I was told that a software update will take a couple hours, so I will be able to drop the car and collect it same day. Unfortunately, once I dropped it in  I was told that diagnostics will take 2-3 days. However, even after 4 days I have not received any update and I was not able to get my car back.\nLast time when I brought my car for servicing I received a video of inspection of my car. To be honest, I pay more attention to details when I am taking video of places of visit that the mechanic who checks the car for safety!\nDon't be tricked by treacle receptionists, look at mechanics work.\nAvoid this garage, don't sign for any servicing plans that they offer - it is not worth.","time":1697191882,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Kerrie Streetin","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117802030846351673426/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUm1Xe-5nRXq9uHlBwp6VZMzc8nEr8_ZRvkLBh5h2TWDGY=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":2,"relative_time_description":"2 weeks ago","text":"Love my new car!!\nHowever the actual experience before getting the car was poor. I changed the colour of the car straight after I put the order in, but that got messed up and so I have ended up with the colour I didn't actually want. When the car arrived in the showroom, the technicians checking the car over managed to break something, so then I had to wait a month for them to get the part and fix it.\nI feel the communication was lacking considering it was their fault and also the  lack of an apology, it felt like they didn't really care. When I eventually collected the car, I was left waiting for over an hour, with no real explanation.\nI thought I may have been offered something from Nissan as a goodwill gesture for all the delays, etc I have experienced, but absolutely nothing.\nI really would reconsider using Nissan again for my next car","time":1700230354,"translated":false},{"author_name":"courage1ism","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114950873765656730964/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUR7QXZLHFzdJOTFXS0JsRYEE_fEsw3uON6ufHInGtSkPI=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"in the last week","text":"Being a disabled driver, I found Hannah Roberts to be kind compassionate, sympathetic as well as professional in responding to my peculiar needs such as  wanting another car as soon as possible because without a vehicle I am stuck in my room all day and every day.
