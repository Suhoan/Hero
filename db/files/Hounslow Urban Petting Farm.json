I thought we go there and from the photos I said okay we stay one hour tops. We ended up staying 3 hours. My son just simply loved it. The animal encounter was very educational and fun. All animals kept good condition. Clear signs if you can  feed and pet the animals. Indoor area is good too. Would it need a little refurbishment? Yes! However they make the best they can. The farm is very clean. (Toilet too) Many places to wash hands. Support this local Urban farm and visit it. Spend a nice day out with your little one.

When we got here we found out that there is a charge to enter which was a surprise! Most farms we have visited are either free or you give a voluntary donation.\n\nThe prices are:\n\nChildren: Â£6\nAdults: Â£7.50\nConcessions: Â£6.75\nFamily: Â£25\n\nWe arrived here late in the afternoon as we had to travel about an hour away so missed the activity sessions.\n\nYou can purchase a bag of food for Â£1 but you do not get much for the price so we shared a bag between us. When asked if I wanted to purchase a bag I said no and the girl (member of staff) at the entrance gave me a dirty look. I just thought for a small bag of food it's not worth it. It should be about 50p a bag for that amount!\n\nOtherwise, toilets were clean and there are hand cleaning stations with sinks to wash your hands after feeding the animals.\n\nThere was a little party going on inside with a bouncy castle for the kids and an information area about the animals which was interesting.\n\nThere was small funfair there for the kids and you would have to pay for the rides.\n\nWhen feeding the animals they looked starving and felt sorry for them. I just wonder if they get fed other times rather than letting members of the public feed them instead.\n\nWhen it was time for the animals to retire one member of staff was social, friendly and informative. She even let my mum hold a rabbit for a little cuddle and told her the correct way to handle them.\n\nI saw on the website that they have a gift shop but unfortunately we didn't see it. It would have been nice to look around.\n\nAnother thing was that you can do a bit of plane spotting while at the farm which was a pretty sight to see! :)","time":1696334003,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Nikita Haritonovs","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115787422911376059239/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXxsyNpsnb2NgpmNlzgsOGu2LZMGwAh2yFcdCuELBa7kG8=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"Nice little farm for kids, recommend attending the show as it adds to the experience being able to hold some of the reptiles.
