In my search for books on Domestic Abuse. I also needed to spend some time in their Local Studies department which you can only visit by appointment. So success was close at hand. I found a couple of non fiction books concerning Domestic Abuse. (Or the Counseling of Domestic Abuse and Violence).The library was fairly busy. But I was able to find a vacant seat so I could make some notes.I did not spend a lot of time in the library. But I could only find a book related to Domestic Violence which had a small directory of; counselling and psychotherapy associations.\nIronically I eventually found a book entitled Domestic Abuse Act 2021 in Foyles bookshop (price @¬£65-70.00)","time":1699670527,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Darius Saul","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100706543931966901173/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWR0OmxOes4E9IhNXl81GanlerMbtub6M6gZjyl8rXgoNc=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":2,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"What‚Äôs a purpose of this huge building, if it‚Äôs open only for certain hours and it‚Äôs closed most of the evenings?
