Although our 8 years old and our 2 years old enjoyed the session we felt robbed after paying the expensive entry tickets due to the outrageous state of the centre!\nWe used to love this place but you just lost a loyal, regular customer-family.","time":1682888965,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Ceisha Simone","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110579426119532632648/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKPbupY6EFxf4oj4T4jp6KWv0Vm9eBEH4Uqa5yo4HFm=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"My son had the best 3rd birthday ever yesterday!
