Its really nice to be able to have a coffee while he plays and he loves a cheeky babychino! Maddy and Alice are absolutely lovely and we really enjoy the Frog-prince class on Tuesday mornings, its a real breath of fresh air as I find some baby classes a bit twee - this one is great fun for kids and parents alike.
