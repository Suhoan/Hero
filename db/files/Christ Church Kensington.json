The architect was Benjamin Ferry , a pupil of the younger Pugin.The interior has been tastefully changed and makes better use of the church , thanks to  Admiral of the Fleet Sir Charles Madden , a philanthropist who served this church for many years.  And I remember the splendid Canon Andrew Pearson who served here for many years.\nCan be reached by walking into Kynance Mews and walking up some steps to the church ( if coming from Gloucester Road and a 49 bus ) , or just walk down Victoria Road .","time":1692816036,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Camilla","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117633078850646822774/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKr2zGMwOZv7cSuZXgW75avmOjTZfEK3Ff4wiyv8v7b=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"Thank you for showing truly generous and kind behaviour & looking after me whilst I tried to find my keys ðŸ˜€\n\nWonderful garden, beautifully maintained","time":1696782166,"translated":false},{"author_name":"jigna mehta","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118318397173518432348/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLYtaaJFsTnNEusUXdxvKkJc8AAHrdDiI-WjR9ZeiOS=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"5 months ago","text":"Lovely church in a central location.
