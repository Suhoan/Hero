It is perfect for a family day out. There are all kinds of animals like chickens, turkeys, rabbits, Guinea pigs, goats, pigs and alpacas. The entry is free but you can make a donation if you want. They offer some food to buy that is appropriate for the goats, pigs and alpacas. The highlight of the place are definitely the baby goats and the alpacas, they are all so friendly and cute. When you give them a palm with food they are very gentle and take the food and eat it. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. There is also a cafe on sight for drinks and light bites. Such a nice experience!","time":1660770534,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Ben Smith","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104632671462944131120/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXGpVx6oksK8uCVDQnrKCM_XVHG7J8xI6vzVRoSVeNTMC8=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":3,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"We've never been to VCF and it was a really fun visit. They have sheep, goats, alpacas, rabbits & a few horses and pigs. Very easy to get to from Vauxhall station but you won't get more than an hour out of it because of course it's very small (only reason for 3/5) and several areas are shut off on the weekend. The cafe on site was great and it had a lovely sense of being a place that was truly embedded in its  community.","time":1695560661,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Bluerosesonmyback","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108203696414732502407/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXDwnJFg3Ww4DbHwk7bgbAimB-Nh-5M3MRTqsQ2t3F18-4=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"3 months ago","text":"Amazing place to go to, small buy charming.
