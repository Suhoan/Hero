I could never find my child's coat, hat & scarf. They were on the floor or just left around the room. Staff aren't very friendly and a bit false when they see you. I'm pretty sure it won Nursery of the year for the building more than anything. They seem to be more interested in getting the numbers at the nursery rather than the welfare of the kids. There are certainly better nurseries especially where the staff are more sincere and genuinely interested in your child and not being fake with parents as I see it.","time":1552351592,"translated":false}],"user_ratings_total":13,"website":"http://www.greenfieldschildren.com/"},"status":"OK","place_id":"ChIJSz09GLdydkgRBqiNmaT8L44","address":"Recreation Rd, Southall UB2 5PF, United Kingdom","categories":["forest school"]}
