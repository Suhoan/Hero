Here are some pros and cons that I have personally experienced. ‚¨á\n\nPros ‚úÖ\n1. The gym premises are very clean, and staff are sanitising very often the machines\n2. Friendly trainers and if you ask their help, they are more than happy to assist you\n3. People in the reception are very kind\n4. The gym has good ventilation, and the space is broad, so even at the peak times, you don't inhale any unpleasant smell\n\nCons ‚ùå\n1. Due to Covid rules, the changing rooms are not in use, even the lockers are out of use (so, in space 2m x 2m, inside the gym room, they have put on the floor, laminated A4 papers with numbers and you leave your personal belongings at any of these available numbers)\n2. If you purchased the ''activeBaseline'' there are specific hours that you can book a slot for free and enter the gym. If you need a different time, you have to pay extra\n\nPS.
