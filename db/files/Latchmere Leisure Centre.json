Lots of lockers, but byo padlock. We could fit a three person family in the locker ok.\nWater was warm and there is a sauna in the corner. This is more family oriented, so be warned. Olympic hopefuls don't bother. I used to crack 5 mile / 8km a session, eight times a week. This is not a pool for that kind of effort.\nGreat for kids and young families.\nDisappointing to see people leave waste behind in the change rooms. Stay classy people. Leave it the way you find it.","time":1698741352,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Shadow 6969","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105198709319030095482/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXm6nzDAaEJ7O1n1E6HhkZW9eRWyBe_hI-q-IilxqH4Pg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":3,"relative_time_description":"5 months ago","text":"Staff have always been cool in my experience.

Only weekends or if I took them outta school for a day which isn’t happening. It’s just a shame. Maybe look into an opening like Tuesday and Thursday open to public swim until 6pm.

My kids love the new play area, the beach approach is great for my baby niece and my preschoolers love the wave machine.\nChanging rooms - not big enough for the numbers of people coming and going,  and anyone sensitive to noise will get a sensory overload because of the hair dryers. I was desperate to leave. Group change locked for the holidays and not enough family changing rooms. Apparently the buggy park is upstairs- this is too far for harassed parents.\nThe cafe is upstairs, initially it looks pleasant, is big and overlooks the pool. It has a softplay which the kids loved.They are very strict about no outside food and where you can and can’t leave your buggy. I’m fine with sticking to rules but the woman working there was incredibly uptight and unfriendly, and service was quite slow. I think i’d rather just be charged for softplay and left alone","time":1691665843,"translated":false}],"user_ratings_total":676,"website":"https://www.placesleisure.org/centres/latchmere-leisure-centre/?utm_source=gmb&utm_medium=button&y_source=1_Njc0OTcwNDItNzE1LWxvY2F0aW9uLndlYnNpdGU%3D"},"status":"OK","place_id":"ChIJZ6stQqAFdkgRN-vB0NS5M80","categories":["leisure centres","sports"],"address":"Burns Rd, London SW11 5AD, United Kingdom"}
