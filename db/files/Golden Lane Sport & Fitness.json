None of the children in that class have moved up a stage, no updates from swimming instructors on when either, when lessons got cancelled they used to issue refunds without any issues until Rhonda started managing and it all fell apart. Weeks and weeks go by without any refunds, no reply to emails, no reply to phone calls, given the runaround by staff who all have a different spin on things when you finally get through! If you go in there’s apparently no managers available, does this Rhonda even exist?! We get told she’s the only one that can issue refunds yet she never seems to be in, never replies to emails calls etc… Absolute shambles. Completely mismanaged. Other parents whose children attend swim lessons seem to be having the exact same issues too, and the funny thing is, they admit to other people having the same problems yet do absolutely nothing to solve them! 3 weeks and counting and still getting absolutely nowhere. Any other business triggers refunds automatically without people having to nag them to death! Cancel your memberships and move elsewhere like i’ve done, save yourselves the hassle of dealing with non existent managers, and swim lessons that don’t seem to advance. Contact your bank for assistance they were great in dealing with them directly.","time":1658502953,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Anna Tomatzidou","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113305734916019816086/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUFwtA5iYqEjFpsMVcPqtA-URciNTY7ISg7jJtxTu4ffmU=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"We went for the swimming pool and we were very disappointed. The pool was utterly disgusting and it had clearly not been cleaned before hand. There were also dead flies in there. There was no AC in the pool so it was extremely hot and the pool itself was reletively small.\nOn the other hand, the changing rooms were very dirty, the lockers didn't close properly so someone could have easily stolen our belongings. The showers were rusty and the floor was atrocious. Let alone the very expensive membership prices. If you are looking for a gym local it's not bad but for anything else it's not worth it.
