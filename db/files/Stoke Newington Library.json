It’s great that kids are allowed to take 30 books out - we’ll definitely make use of that as she gets older. There are baby change facilities but sadly not accessible - you have to go up 3 steps to get them - far from ideal with a pram. There are also disabled toilets but those in a wheelchair would have to use the stair lift to get up to them as similarly, there are stairs in the way!  A couple of ramps could address both of these accessibility obstacles.

I can say this place it is not a nursery ( in my knowledge , maybe I am wrong) and should not be used in that way, people should speak a little bit less louder and be more respectful of person who are using ( or at least trying!) the library for reading/ learning purposes. I just see people around acting like this library is a park with a roof, parents who are touring children around without any intention to take a book/ movie / or  studying and most important even trying to keep their children quiet in any sort of way.
