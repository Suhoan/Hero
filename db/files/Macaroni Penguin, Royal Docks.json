I had visited Macaroni Penguin with my niece for children's play time. It is a lovely getaway for parents who wish to have a catch-up with friends whilst with their children. A fun, clean and well lit area for kids to play safely. (There is a guarded gate). This also happens to be a T4, one of the best if not the only T4 I have visited with a play area and all the amazing drinks you would come to expect from any T4 chain. I wish I had more time to spend here as you can virtually work from a laptop with the plug points, whilst catching up over a drink with friends or another parent and child. Employees are super friendly and helpful. Place is clean and hygienic. They clean and sanitise the play and seating area after every guest.","time":1641330914,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Jonathan McConnell","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114257476441703268867/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVOteHXgCytmpdtqEFu-7kNMVsniD3GhrV6hj_99sY7T14=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"Great selection of bubble tea.
