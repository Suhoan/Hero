The young woman working there was clearly having a bad day! She arrived late to start the play session, so there was a queue of customers waiting in the street. The delay was blamed on needing to do shopping for her absent manager.\n\nHaving started late, there was no indication that the play session was due to end until the girl shouted that the session was over. As a result, there was a queue of parents trying to change their children‚Äôs nappies before leaving. I was unfortunate enough to be last in the queue and rudely reminded about the 1.5 hour session duration.\n\nSome feedback:\n-Play a tidy up song / make an announcement to inform caregivers that the session is due to end in 15 mins, this will help prevent the bathroom queues.\n- Buy/ make some fresh cakes.\n- Encourage staff to be polite to customers","time":1699052563,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Ralph Wilson","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111365348191920736027/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKlKyOPkT-p7iqIVatft_BALycoVlA4iybHljANB9zU=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"We had my daughter‚Äôs 2nd birthday party here and had a brilliant time.
