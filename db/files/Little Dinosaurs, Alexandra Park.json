The food is great and a large selection to choose from.\n\nMy only gripe is that quite often there are older children in the toddler area and this doesn't seem to be monitored by staff or the carers of the children. Quite annoying when you have a big kid collide with your toddler in an area there not even supposed to be in.\n\nOverall, it's our favourite soft play and I love that they don't charge adults like most other soft plays.","time":1688412532,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Clea Romeo","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115893012231908767722/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV7SeWo3njvDSWo5PSHfqYWnzahVsS-Fx-VSHtv5OL2SxQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"3 months ago","text":"Visited for the first time and it’s a great place for toddlers.
