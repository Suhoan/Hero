Me and my daughter visited today as a spur of the moment. I can honestly say it's really fun. Reasonable price, I'd prefer it maybe a tad cheaper for the length of time, epically price wise for children could be cheaper. The actors are amazing. The history part was just enough for you to take it in and not got bored I felt. The Chapel was amazing. The bar scene with Jack the ripper was amazing  and I love how they stay in character to give your guidelines. So my 8 year old braved the tombs, to which she absolutely loved but did cry at one particular actor  which was funny for me. She's already said she wants to go again.
