It's the PCs that are for one hour and if you want a second hour you can pay £1, there are 3 desks with plugs. You can sit anywhere else in the library using battery. Nice place but I understand they're very short of regular staff and have to get cover from other branches so some staff are not as in the know as others.","time":1638972062,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Sasha Freudenthal","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115771904075970018372/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocI4w1Yi8p-N4AMYdXoRcNcwRgyMH5p98Zs-IXjth98l=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":2,"relative_time_description":"2 years ago","text":"The library space is nice but they have a nonsensical rule whereby you can only use the working desks for 1 hour at a time. After one hour, the guard came and sent me away even though noone else was there. I wanted to move to one of the tables with computers but wasn't allowed to use my own laptop at this table.

I tried to print out but made the mistake to use the wrong computer. When the attendant finally returned, she seemed to take pleasure in shouting at me in front of everyone.
