I would recommend the tour even if you've been to Wimbledon before. There are lots of interesting facts. You get to go behind the scenes & sit in the chairs & behind the actual desk previously used by the tennis stars during their Wimbledon post-match interviews.  In the museum itself, seeing the trophies & kits previously worn by some of the greats was a particular highlight.
