Seems to have enough place for aprox. 2000 guests. Thrre is a gakery as well, where there are seated places. Maybe for some events there are seated places on groundfloor as well, but this concert was standing.\n\nImmediately after opening, there formed a very long queue for the toilets. The queue stayed there. So i assume there are very few toilets.\n\nYou can buy beverages inside the church.\n\nA key feature if the room is a very large organ.\n\nAcoustics were fine.\n\nNext to the church you will find a supermarket, busstations. (The venue is about 30 mins from the tube by bus).\n\nIt was a Gary Numan acoustic concert.","time":1697964748,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Patrick McDougall","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115526278556822757429/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVezBwVpip-aA9bcANqsoRhmfu-E3HROMvBROde_zfp29W8=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"Fabulous venue.
