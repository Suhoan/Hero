Beautiful flowers, exquisite ambience, lovely people, lively recreational facilities, and even relaxing chairs to sit under the sun. A place like this leaves you realizing how much beauty there is to life itself, and then saddens you that we lose all that to the hustle and bustle of everyday life and our pursuit of nothing.
