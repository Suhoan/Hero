The otter talk at 11am, repeated at 2pm, was wonderful. So gorgeous to see these beautiful creatures up close and personal. It was amazing to go into well appointed hides not realising what was behind, only to see a beautiful lake full of wildlife. Overall beautiful landscaping and natural looking buildings made it a lovely place to visit and a delicious steak pie and veg was the icing on the cake.","time":1697961949,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Emine Bir","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102549763603511423949/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUgaRCbe-Ba8UiQRHUFUMwhgn2HFo7maqtRizN84xH1kw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"3 months ago","text":"We had a very lovely day at London Wetland Center. It is worth the ticket price to enjoy the nature and get informed. We visited at a weekday so it wasn‚Äôt much crowded. If you want to see the otters be by their pool earlier than the feeding time cause people block the windows with strollers. I didn‚Äôt know that they built the place out of nothing l was very impressed.

Visit the otters and listen to the talk at 11am or go pond dipping, go to the playground and play with the water feature or crawl through the tunnels, then have lunch at the cafe and then upstairs to the indoor play area. Simple fun and easy to cycle to if you go along the river.   Pie and sides was ¬£12.95.  Children's menu - mini fish and chips ¬£7 and Sausage hot dog ¬£5.  Easy enough to walk around with lots of benches for rest stops.  Bathrooms easy to find and clean.   Recommend bringing a picnic as we saw lots of families doing that.  If you like gum nuts and gum leaves, then there is a World Wetlands area.  Can easily spend 4 to 5 hours here just slowly wandering around.","time":1692283836,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Janet Smith","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106143270169802059480/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJljZjVqb-xXGuALhRGl3eZ0JauivXyQuyxsGdDAzj6=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"3 months ago","text":"This place is absolutely wonderful, my husband and I visited the centre for the first time and I can assure you, it won't be the last.
