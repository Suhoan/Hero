This time (June 2023) was to see the limited run of We Will Rock You and the experience was very much better. As in most of the West End theatres, a bag search is carried out before entry. In this case, the box ticked must have been 'Yup, carrying a bag' :-) with the process taking less than five seconds. The London Coliseum is the largest theatre in London seating over 2,000 for stage performances. Our seats tonight were in the Stalls, so downstairs. Where to go was not immediately clear, but the many staff around were polite, professional and very helpful. The seating rows in the Stalls were well-tiered, and had good upholstery padding, and were very comfortable. Leg room was also very good. The show, We Will Rock You, had many bad reviews during the opening couple of weeks, but this was certainly not our (Sister, her Husband and myself) experience. Having seen the original show, ? 25 years ago at the Dominion Theatre, Tottenham Court Road, this show was amazing. Apart from the cast who were all more than just good, displaying their athletic ability in great choreography number whilst belting out the numbers, the settings and lighting really stand out. This had really been brought up to date with lots of recent event references in the script, and the use of back projection images was mind blowing. Given the show, the audience was invited to join in for some numbers, think clapping to the beat ;-) and did so with great abandon. I just cannot understand why people complain about this show. It is not as if they don't know the plot :-). Summing up, great Theatre and world class show. Now can I book tickets before the show ends on 27 August ? Might be a Birthday Treat is in order.","time":1687516328,"translated":false},{"author_name":"kaustubh kabre","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104068138318400003935/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWq80ionw-W9t-V4dnQNU3hSG9IsEtkMmywQyLrQb3rKg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"4 months ago","text":"The venue itself is smaller compared to some other venues.
