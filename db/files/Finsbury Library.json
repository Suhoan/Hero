However some library staff really need to take a chill pill.. my one year old pulled some books off the shelf in children’s section which she does every time we go, I simply put the books back on the shelf ( even in order). My child is literally a baby exploring her surroundings no damage or harm being caused and I as her mother will always ensure everything is left in its right place.\nAn older gentleman absolutely lost his mind and got very snappy.. wouldn’t let me pick up the literal 6 books and made us feel so uncomfortable. I haven’t returned since due to fear my baby might touch a book!

The staff were so sweet and helpful. We had just been sort-of turned away by nearby fashionable restaurant Morito so to be welcomed on a rainy day and treated with care and kindness felt like the best kind of public service.\n\nPeople who work in libraries and who deal with people from all walks of life, a place of refuge and for community to come together- these people are heroes!  This library is the kind of place that provides deep kind nourishment...and no matter how privileged or insulated we feel we may be, we all, at some point (like we felt at Morito,) feel excluded, and this place made me and my child feel included.  Thank you sweet and lovely Finsbury Library, you helped soothe a difficult day for two very grateful customers :)  What you do is amazing - you 'hold' a place for everyone in the community.","time":1667721655,"translated":false}],"user_ratings_total":44,"website":"https://www.islington.gov.uk/libraries-arts-and-heritage/libraries/your-local-libraries/finsbury-library"},"status":"OK","place_id":"ChIJZeqjvlobdkgRi51gGMn2BuU","address":"245 St John St, London EC1V 4NB, United Kingdom","categories":["libraries"]}
