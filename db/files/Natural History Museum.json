There are so many exhibits and so much to learn and see! It’s fun whether u are a kid or an adult. The staff are friendly and eager to help you if you need assistance. Many public bathrooms are available around the museum. The building itself is also very impressive and has amazing architecture. The dinosaur exhibit was the highlight of my trip but I loved everything else in the museum too! So many things here has so much historical significance and long history’s and stories behind them. The minerals are so pretty and have the most beautiful colours. There is a lot of interactive activities as well which are entertaining. Food is available in many places in the museum and there are so many places to sit if you are tired.","time":1700335310,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Lanie Fu","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115080662417480049684/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLwjqNxQuc6Aoqh8rXsM3X9KbjmikxJUMa2u_pE3mKR=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"a week ago","text":"My visit to the London Natural History Museum was a nice experience, although I anticipated it to be a bit larger. Despite its size, the museum offered a concise and engaging journey through natural history.\n\nOne standout feature was the cool earthquake room, which added an interactive and educational element to the visit. It was a unique experience that brought science to life.\n\nWhile I managed to navigate through the museum relatively quickly, I appreciated the variety of exhibits and the effort put into making each display informative and interesting.\n\nIf you're looking for a museum experience that doesn't require a whole day, the London Natural History Museum is worth a visit","time":1700599400,"translated":false},{"author_name":"J.

We normally come on weekends with our little one. It is quite overwhelming for a young toddler to be in here. It is quite noisy and many traffic even though the museum is huge!\n\nIf you enter from the main gate, you will find the iconic ‘Hope’ blue whale skeleton up in the ceiling. The hall is with such high ceilings and lights come through the windows.\n\nIt is one of the best places to visit with kids in winter. It’s one of our favourite winter activities in London. The dinosaur room has a huge model with sounds. The kids love it.\n\nDo go upstairs if you want the best view of the museum, you will get a great photo!","time":1699569849,"translated":false},{"author_name":"SebCeleste M","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110064044444597861514/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXXELfipwgeyeM4Sei4u5wXLEcd8BjjtbAcTreXcJEHiRw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"An absolutely stunning museum with many new renewed exhibits. The dinosaur exhibit was such a huge success with the kids and they even had life-size dinosaur installations all over the museum. The gift shop is a nice place to pick out a variety of gifts for all ages and prices.\n\nThe only challenge was navigating the museum during mid-terms and when it’s holidays all over Europe. The queue to enter was huge, it moved quickly though but once inside, it was an intense time with the crowded spaces and managing little ones.","time":1698680315,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Luke Sherran","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110571147947470365286/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVafoSVj6BJWkrZiQYhqe6MKOV86TxQXWM1zC2reTzEM-E=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"3 months ago","text":"I've always wanted to go to the Natural History Museum, so I was very exicted to finally get the opportunity to visit. We visited on a Friday, and should definitely have booked tickets in advance to save the queue time outside. The staff did very well to get us all in, but it was busy, and we had to wait a while to get in.\n\nThe exhibits are amazing. I loved the huge scale of all the prehistoric fossils, and the building itself is beautiful. The dinosaur and marine sections were really enjoyable for me. It took a few hours to view just these zones alone, so you could easily spend the whole day there if you wanted.\n\nSome of the popular areas are very busy, so you have to be patient if you want to see everything. Because of the volume of visitors, it can get very hot! They added some portable fans and air conditioning units into some of the rooms, which took the edge off, but we skipped some of the really hot areas.\n\nIn between the visit we went to the cafe, which was pretty reasonably priced and had a nice lunch box for kids.\n\nIt's definitely worth buying a map (it costs £1) as the place is huge, and it would easy to miss a few of the rooms. For a free museum, the place is amazing and definitely worth some extra donations as you enter. The only negative is that as the museum got busier and busier, we became keen to leave and rushed through the last few rooms. This will obviously be different depending when you visit, but definitely recommended.","time":1692993679,"translated":false}],"user_ratings_total":23846,"website":"https://www.nhm.ac.uk/"},"status":"OK","place_id":"ChIJPy8Y5kIFdkgRxGSXw4Xjt3s","categories":["museums"],"address":"Cromwell Rd, South Kensington, London SW7 5BD, United Kingdom"}
