month ago","text":"I'm giving the place 2 stars purely because of my class instructor, who was very engaging and motivating. However this Better centre is absolutely shocking and definitely the worst I've encountered in terms of facilities and hygiene standards.\n\nFirstly: fitness classes. I have never been to another Better gym - or gym full-stop - that doesn't host classes in a studio space. This place hosts certain classes in a massive sports hall, which is split in half. The other half of the space is used to run kids' activities. As you can imagine, it's hard to stay focused on your class when there are kids screaming in the background. It's also very uncomfortable and awkward doing classes in there as the floor above (including the cafe) overlooks the gym, which means there are always people gawping at class-goers as if it's a human zoo. Really not great for self-conscious exercisers. It's really not an appropriate space for intensive classes, and I'm shocked that a centre so huge hasn't built in proper studios.\n\nMy other huge gripe is the appalling changing room facilities for the sports hall. They sit in a miserable airless and dimly lit basement space. There are NO private showers. The only option is a cluster of prison-style showers, which have a tiny dribble of water coming out of them. I don't know about you, but I'm not at all comfortable showering naked in front of a load of strangers. I can't believe this exists in this day and age! It also reeked of poo, coming from ONE solitary toilet cubicle nearby. There's also only one hairdryer in these changing rooms, which isn't great.\n\nThe lockers are another let-down. There's no consistency between Better gyms and how their lockers work. I've been to one that only accepts token payments, while several others accept pound coins. But this branch only accepts 20p coins. I felt like I'd been thrust back to the early 90s.","time":1698851815,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Sinéad Browne","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115447369505894059630/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLrUFy-2s8tZeiU_yKNXJUkF0UU1QpwWhXnFw2aIK-z=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":3,"relative_time_description":"3 weeks ago","text":"Have only used the swimming pool here and it's pretty good, does the job.
