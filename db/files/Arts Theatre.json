I can't find a single thing not to love about it. The location is just a minute's walk from Leicester Square station, making it incredibly convenient. The bar is welcoming and adds to the overall experience.\n\nThe theatre itself is small and cosy, and no matter where you sit, you're practically right next to the stage. I don't think there's a bad seat in the house with restricted views. The legroom is also great, providing extra comfort during the show.\n\nSpeaking of the show, \"The Choir of Man\" was incredibly enjoyable! I went with my beloved and her 86-year-old mum, and they had an absolute blast. I was pleasantly surprised to see that there were only a few unsold seats because this show deserves a full audience every night. I hope it continues running for years to come.\n\nWhile the stage setting may not be overly sophisticated, it more than makes up for it with the talent on display. The singers, dancers, and actors were all incredibly skilled and put on a remarkable performance. The song selection was fantastic, with beautiful harmonization throughout. The show also pays a great homage to the British pub institution.\n\nI can't wait to see \"The Choir of Man\" again. If you have the means to splurge a little for a front-row seat and a chance to be a part of the show, I highly recommend it. It's an experience you'll remember for a lifetime!","time":1686314185,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Katya Masnyk","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104667270677490217010/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKMkMOHACNftpChx3kC113UHHc8jjcaDBVXeMO6hTkU=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 weeks ago","text":"Small theatre allowing for a really “at-home” immersive vibe.
