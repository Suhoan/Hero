By far the most advanced in the borough. Hackney is levelling up! Hackney is very lucky to have such a beautiful modern building like this. The staff are always friendly and helpful. Can‚Äôt complain at all. Gym staff are always keeping the equipment safe and tidy in the gym, cleaning up the mess left by others who leave weights lying around. Why some are complaining about this gym in the reviews is beyond me. This is ten times better than the old Britannia if you care to remember? You are getting the best gym equipment you could ever dream of as there are plenty of other gyms out there still using aging gym equipment ! The equipment at Britannia is up to high stand and there are plentiful machines at this gym: more than enough for everyone to use. People coming onto Google reviews - looking for small faults at this gym is actually quite pathetic really- they have nothing better to do in their spare time. Cleaners are working through the clock to keep this place clean as possible and they are on point. So don‚Äôt listen to people making silly past-judgement complaints about cleanliness at Britannia. If you want to know about cleanliness, please go check out how bad Clissold leisure centre is. Some of these guys complaining, don‚Äôt even live in the area and have the audacity to complain about it! Mate, you guys were not born n bred in these endz of Hackney to make such comments. Hackney is levelling up for us locals not you outer Hackney ppl!\n\nHere are some things that I found need fixing at Britannia. There are some treadmill machines in the gym that are making loud squeaky and banging noises and this is very dangerous as the belt could slip or snap and cause a major accident. Another thing is that members are taking the actual p**s by claiming the lockers in the men‚Äôs changing rooms and taking the key home. Total liberties! Management need to fix this because I can Never get a free locker in the men‚Äôs changing room. This is letting the leisure centre down. Another thing I would say is a let down is the showers. They should‚Äôve spent more on the shower system. The current ones are bog standard cheap. Shower water pressure at Britannia is weak and water is a bit too hot.","time":1689984350,"translated":false},{"author_name":"KIK","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114717166599312597989/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVcf-aq8-ufDSiPje8BrhRuLagyLH86DeAVuDlqNPIMuoI=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"6 months ago","text":"Great as no other in London!\n1.

Your finger kills before you dry your hair which is slower at drying than a 1970‚Äôs hairdryer\n2. They let the people from the time before stay longer / go on the slide üõù so we ended up having less time there as had to queue for ages to the only slide available\n3.

The reception had an incredibly rude member of staff, who tried to first deny us entry and then made us wait 20 minutes before we could even enter, really bizarre experience clearly she was having a bad day and just wanted to take it out on us. However a manager came over and sorted it within 5 minutes and we were in, he also gave us the time she wasted back.\nFloors are really slippery throughout the changing rooms, and showers are cold, the inside of changing cubicles are definitely not checked regularly people had left dirty nappies and food ect. The slots are only a hour so make sure you arrive in good time to change and be ready to enter as it‚Äôs your turn. Also the swimming pool and splash park are separate so make sure you know what you book for.  Lastly i think it was extremely busy for the space it is in. I recommend both adults and children wearing swimming no slip shoes/socks.\n\nThe positives - we booked via the better app and it was definitely value for money, two adults, one child and two under threes came to ¬£15.\n\nThe overall changing rooms were clean, just not the cubicles. The splash park was immaculate, and everything looked brand new. Water was warm perfect for little ones. There was three different stations to keep the kids busy.\n\nOverall I‚Äôm glad we visited, however I wouldn‚Äôt go out my way to come again.","time":1691627990,"translated":false}],"user_ratings_total":717,"website":"https://www.better.org.uk/leisure-centre/london/hackney/britannia-leisure-centre?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=google_my_business"},"status":"OK","place_id":"ChIJzZempqIcdkgRa72GW5bvpCU","address":"Pitfield St, London N1 5FT, United Kingdom","categories":["water play"]}
