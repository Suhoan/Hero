Loads of lovely sensory toys for babies, and various play areas and themes for older toddlers and children. Quality toys and a beautiful selection of both French and English books with several cute reading nooks that include adult size chairs for if your little one wants you to get involved and you don't want to be sat on the floor!\n\nHad a lovely coffee and some baked goods from the cafe. Unicorn cookies were a must for our daughter - they were both gorgeous and delicious. Seating is arranged to have a view of the whole room and little ones can wander over with toys if they want to show you something.\n\nBoth our 18 month old and 3.5 year old had a fabulous time. We'll definitely be back and be recommending to friends. Service was so welcoming, friendly and yet relaxed and the place is SPOTLESSLY clean!

I was pleasantly surprised to see how clean and nice it was. They have lots of different toys and books to discover, i went with a baby, a toddler and a 6 year old and all of them had a great time. The pastries and cakes at the cafe were very nice and the hot chocolate we had was quite big. The 2 ladies on site were very helpful, smiley and welcoming. It was also easy to park on the streets around. My only suggestion to improve is the fact that the entrance is very small and it was a bit stressful coming in and out as we had to carry our big pram and put the shoes on/off and it was a bit difficult. Some buggies were left outside in the street as there was no more space inside which i wouldnt have liked. Apart from that, it is a wonderful place to go with children and a great way to spend the day.","time":1698329547,"translated":false},{"author_name":"P S","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113695420151242095205/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUtzEI0PN8LuIsxhyvGizv1Va5IKWPbBV-fHlr4HdFJIjC4=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"We had a lovely time here, my daughter loved playing with all the toys and even made friends with the other parents and children.
