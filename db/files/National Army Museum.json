Didn't get to look around the museum, as we came for the Play Base session, we came to the 10am session which was busy, but well managed that it did not feel crowded. We booked in advance, was sold out by the time we got there. It was an hour's session which was perfect as the room is on the small side, so your older kids won't get lost in there, perfect for my little one to burn himself out. Tickets  weren't too expensive, would definitely consider bringing him once a week or every few weeks.\n\nThe museum facilities are good, cafe was nice, on the pricy side for food, so opted for a herbal tea. But would definitely come back to explore the rest of the museum and come to the cafe for a coffee/tea as it is very family friendly. Judging by the amount of buggies there it seems that if it is decent alternative to other local soft play sessions. As the Play Base space is small I would recommend taking babies and toddlers during term time in school hours as can imagine it would be carnage when older children are there.","time":1697200406,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Conny","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103947719073057288122/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJfrgqPjNjR73Sk6772fRfcTlZAEb7clLjqp932Hvnw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a week ago","text":"The National Army Museum in Chelsea is a captivating tribute to military history.
