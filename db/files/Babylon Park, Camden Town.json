Particularly perfect for rainy days, as everything is indoors! The place was clean and well staffed, and the staff were very helpful. Obviously quite pricey, you top up a Babylon card and swipe it to play each game or for each person to go on a ride. You can add money to your card at machines within the park. Food  drinks and seating area available. Toilet and baby changing facilities are available, but you have to swipe your card to use them. There are lots of arcade games and a few rides available.

It is spread over two floors and has a top floor also closest to the entrance/exit.\n\nIt has a mixture of rides and games and was sure entertaining for the kids as well as myself as there were also rides/games suitable for adults to join in with to.\n\nThere is a card/app system where you can pay to use credit and tap upon entering the games/rides. You can also top up the card.\n\nWe had good fun and made the most of our time, the kids also enjoyed the soft play area for over 3s' and next to it there was a small baby play room.\n\nWe went by public transport which wasn't too difficult to get two since we don't live so close. But it does get very busy and the area itself is very packed so be cautious of your belongings and hold your children's hands tightly.\n\nHoping that next time we can play more games to win more tickets in aim of getting some prizes too.","time":1692388393,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Daniela Olivier","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101847167020888399406/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLnLi_UdIg7mfJrNIcy3bo6IiNwxZRyaXtW1o66a-LB=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"in the last week","text":"extremely nice and helpful staff (Mr. from Ukraine was super helpful right in the beginning) we truly enjoyed our stay my son who is 9 had 2 hours of fun and we won a lot of tickets so he was super happy to be able to get a plush toy and many more!
