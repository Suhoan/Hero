We kept an eye as best we could, and she had a whale of a time, she made new friends and gained confidence and didn't miss us at all!!

My girls absolutely loved it and we came back the next day. They've made me promise to come twice a week! Staff friendly and helpful. I would love to see the old \"tuck shop\" opened again.
