Inside was the same too! As there were stairs leading to different areas.\n\nThe gift shop was very expensive! But it was nice to have a little wonder and look around.\n\nThere are a number of seats to sit down and places to chill.\n\nThere was a music shop and wanted to visit there but did not have a clue in how to reach that particular area.
