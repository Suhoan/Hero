My son is quite shy, but they worked hard to help him settle, and really took the effort to get to know him personally, and now he loves going and it's been great to see him grow in confidence and friendship with the other children. The nursery is designed to give children lots of opportunities to explore and try new things, and there's a lovely emphasis on nature including a 'forest school' area.","time":1646771098,"translated":false},{"author_name":"alex","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102692206646211730800/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIaYaOt7iymoDZbDjv6qmRWFfVifGO6NhnFMqjmy1pH=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"Hamden way nursery in Southgate is an amazing nusery.

I don't know about the three year old groups but early years group which is two to three year olds were just spending the time on their own with no encouragement for learning. There are limited toys to play and they are not on display because the room isn't big enough. Same for the garden. Just a few things outside. Also no encouragement to take part in activities. If you have a shy child like mine, they can always be left out. My little girl missed the nursery for almost a week and no call was made to find out if she's ok which clearly shows the lack of management. The worst is when raised these and a few more concerns to the head, she was so defensive and even though I was speaking very politely and not criticising harshly, she was so rude to hang up the phone without even saying bye! Bye bye Hampden Way.","time":1489848517,"translated":false}],"user_ratings_total":3,"website":"https://hampdenway.barnet.sch.uk/"},"status":"OK","place_id":"ChIJrwgMO6gZdkgR5SrvLMzeCYk","address":"Hampden Way, London N14 5DJ, United Kingdom","categories":["forest school"]}
