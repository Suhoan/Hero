The theatre was clean and tidy and well laid out. The queue for the bar was long, but if you go downstairs, there is another bar which is less busy. Toilets, albeit small, we're adequate and clean. I was seated in the stalls, which are perfectly fine, but you could be unlucky and have a tall person sat in front of you that would spoil your view. Sit near the front if you can afford it. I didn't like the fact that at the end of the show they asked the audience to donate to charity, I had just spent £80 to see the show, use some of my £80 to give to charity if you want to, don't ask me for more!","time":1700990959,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Kim Dobson","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105160536816608361286/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIyn1FH1wLDnVtn4mRuIBnq3fWU3uLSQAtfE4wdYOOs=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"2 weeks ago","text":"What a gorgeous theatre!

They are professional and pleasant and appropriately engaging. They are highly trained and it shows as there is nothing at all to complain about.\nThe seats are as you would expect from an older west end theatre where there is just not enough space for your feet/legs as it is a really tight squeeze if you are 5ft 10inches and mostly legs not body! I tend not to book any shows that are absurdly long in duration as it becomes less comfortable (even in the more expensive seats).\n\nThe refreshments at the break are reasonable and priced similarly to all west end theatres. So you choose to eat before or after, or of course buy something as a treat. (Prosecco is nice and the ice creams are great).\n\nThe musical attended this last time was \"Aspects of Love\" The character Alex was fantastic his voice and acting was great. I didn't see Michael Ball as I attended on Monday however his replacement was also quite brilliant.\n\nTwo other \"stars\" were \"Jenny\" who seem to shine amazingly, and surely must be a star in the making, sje would come.across so.well both on stage and film, a super performance.\n\nThe other supporting actress who really came alive was the one who played Alex's love interest, at the end. It was all super.\n\nGlad i went and will return!","time":1692270724,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Pauline L","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107950455786266854496/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXQNsggmIEejSKCsfu027dCrOBEBtOpoC7MSQiAwrwdtvVQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"Great Traditional Theatre,, gives the feeling of an intimate venue.\nWent to see @LaVoix absolutely fantastic.
