Excellent session. Thank you. ðŸ’™\n\nA place where even adults have fun ðŸ¥³ Went out in the terrible rain today, only to be greeted so nicely by staff opening the door, so I can get in quickly. She was very helpful and polite and simply told me where to put my buggy, where I had to put my sons shoes and the cost/timing etc. Went to the back, parked my buggy, came to desk to pay. Another very polite and helpful lady and off we went to play. My son found some new friends to play with, so I went to sit down and saw a cute little corner serving tea, coffee and much more. Again, a big smiley and friendly young lady. Hands down this place is awesome. It's not super big but it's PERFECT for its purpose. We went to have fun and we surely had that. That's ALL that matters. Definitely will be going again as its great fun and the staff are very welcoming and helpful. Thank you for staying open so our kids can come have fun, whilst we relax and have a cuppa.
