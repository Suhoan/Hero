However, it seems to have a bit of an identity problem: at around 15:30 the local kids start to make a LOT of noise and it isn‚Äôt clear if your in a library or a daycare. This wouldn‚Äôt be such an issue if the time was clearly designated for children or if the place was open for longer (they open at 11 then close for lunch between 13:00 till 14:00 and 18:00 is final closing). This leaves precious little time for people using the library, you know, the way their supposed to be used. It‚Äôs not a great space for reading or working. There are also other rooms that could be designated as either a  quiet working space or a children‚Äôs section, rather than having both lumped in together.\nI hope they look into some rearrangements  that could benefit both young families and the students who seem desperate for space to work.","time":1652457286,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Heather Chan","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100771711542163780113/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIK68Y8B-7eFNxpQWWS4HPjB7SWt62_S1eGVrq76dUT=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":2,"relative_time_description":"3 years ago","text":"Extremely noisy after 3:30pm since that the time kids finish school, they play toys, they run around they scream and shout.
