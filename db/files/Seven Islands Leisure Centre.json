Why is there not one inside each changing room? There are posters saying drink water in the sauna and posters saying you must be dressed when going out.

Machines constantly out of order, also some that are running don't work properly, like the tradmills that won't incline. Place is also dirty and general overall tired feel. The thing that has topped it off is the water machine that has broken down.. No drinking facilities on site. The water from that machine also tastes really dirty, not sure if it's even clean.\n\nAnother annoying thing is that this gym allows locals to bring family members free on certain days, so mums decide to bring along a clan of kids who hog the cardio machines. They quite clearly don't want to be there, and have no idea what the hell they are doing either. This shouldn't be allowed.\n\nThe membership price is decent and you get two other gyms to use, but the one in Southwalk park doesn't have enough cardio machines, and the one by the water doesn't have enough weights. At least they are both a little more clean and decent though.\n\nThe pool also is dirty and the smell of chlorine could knock you out.\n\nGuys you really need to consider doing a refurb and stop the free family days as it promotes a baby sitting service","time":1696021904,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Dramatic Strawlk","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104931199247322098875/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUmIN_kqPYJztWgCFd4GjPnKYykTSZh9_t7HoiYll4j1g=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"3 months ago","text":"The pool was great but minus 1 star  because the bottom of the pool is a little bit dirty.
