It is especially nice to come here with children and babies.  Dozens of mothers with baby strollers in the place will testify to this.\nOn the day we were there, there were several classes of school children.  When we arrived they sat and listened to the teachers.  Towards noon, they took off their uniforms and entered the shallow pool in bathing suits.  At the entrance to the garden, you can see some old photos of the place are displayed, as well as of the children in bathing suits from the 40's and 50's having fun in the pool.  The garden is dedicated to one of the founding fathers of the town.\nYou can read about it at the entrance to the garden.  When I was in the park I felt how the green color enveloped me from all sides.  The trees are huge and shade part of the park.\nThere is a playground for children.  With a climbing device made of ropes.  Swings of different types and more.  My grandchildren had a great time.\nBy the pool there is a kiosk in a beautiful architectural structure.  Back in the 40's, they spent time thinking about the small details, that the structure would look beautiful and not just be functional.  The place also has toilets.","time":1689927118,"translated":false},{"author_name":"J T","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111890353077431767893/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKWjHzdFcKjD7MxD31eVm9OC4j03MBvu5EsNoRWsrgd=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"5 months ago","text":"We spent a lovely hour here today. My granddaughter loved the water which was warmed by the sun. A great place for a picnic, decent toilets a few metres away. Car park was approximately a £ an hour.\n\nA surprising amount of police patrols in the area , some were community police. All very relaxed, maybe it’s a meeting point.\n\nOnly gripe was the price of the ice cream from the van which I think was called Steve’s. I ordered two knickerbocker glory ice creams at £5 each ( genuinely thinking we were in for a treat ) Photo shows you what I got.  Two small plastic cups with a bit of sauce and a tiny flake which has been split to make two. Quite disgusting really.\n\nI’ll definitely be back to the park but I’ll give the van a miss. His photo isn’t representative of the item you receive.","time":1687549977,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Paul Brown","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114675886244482828876/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWxgA6q7gk-eH-KUcpjd-Xla-5YVRJaSZ3XKxY0Mjcmbhw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"I think this is the best free park in a 50 mile radius.
