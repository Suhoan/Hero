I love it as it's not too busy.  It's also just the right size - not too big, not too small, which makes it just big enough for kids to have lots to do but small enough to keep an eye on them from one spot and not have to follow them too much.\n\nSomehow the relatively high surrounding buildings and trees makes it feel less of a London playground and more of a New York playground :)\n\nOne of my favourite playgrounds and just a 5 min walk from Russell Square tube.  It isn't huge and it isn't green. In fact, its sandwiched between the back of a Hilton and a housing block.  However, it's shady, surrounded by trees, never busy and super quiet and peaceful.  One side has monkey bars etc - basically an outdoor gym for adults (which teenagers love and my 5 year old daughter loves too) and the other side is for little kiddies.\n\nIt's not fancy or fashionable but there is something about it being nestled away in the recesses of larger buildings and the quietness of it that is quite sweet...makes a change from the coram fields’ playgrounds of this place part of the world.  I like to think that this is one of my favourite little pocket playgrounds …it’s understated and sometimes that’s just what you need.","time":1690620962,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Zhang Ze","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116215956489128989531/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWBNK76ClrVnE4b1_gSOOiJYZD-HFhfHm36W1qtNEdV9w=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"no water , but others are good!
