Staff are great and very helpful. During the busy times it’s a bit crammed considering its size. Could use more showers but I guess the building was originally planned to be used for the student accommodation above; happy it’s a public facility instead.

First, the staff at the reception seem hesitant to accept Gympass users by saying they don’t know how it works and they can’t let you in or they need to speak to a manager. Second, I got there on Saturday and steam room and sauna were not working, staff said they switch it on only at 2pm (which doesn’t make any sense and they should have mentioned it at the reception) and they have three of staff members on swimming pool floor who seemingly do nothing and are utterly unhelpful if asked for any kind of help (like hot water not working in the showers).\nI understand the venue is perhaps saving the costs by having sauna off but they should review their usage of the staff and perhaps train them to be more customer focused.\nThe venue also doesn’t have parking. Swimming pool only 1meter deep, good for kids but if you are looking for good swimming and sauna/ steam room experience, avoid this place.","time":1698530319,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Rosie Galbally","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112676722852945049767/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUGnQc7rkYueb2pBMtctX0n_YNwcB31KZRrAlE-PbN6MVeA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"Very nice staff and great  community atmosphere.\nGood pool, steam room and sauna.\nNot many showers - but remember it's super cheap!","time":1696329486,"translated":false}],"user_ratings_total":316,"website":"https://www.better.org.uk/leisure-centre/london/lambeth/vauxhall-leisure-centre?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=google_my_business"},"status":"OK","place_id":"ChIJHWMzzX0FdkgROEqhrSRVxSI","categories":["leisure centres","sports","swimming"],"address":"50 S Lambeth Rd, London SW8 1DY, United Kingdom"}
