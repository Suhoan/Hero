I definitely recommend booking in the morning as it’s easy and quick to enter and no long lines. Staff were extremely friendly. It wasn’t crowded for the 10:30am slot so i was able to enjoy lots of it while it was a bit empty.\n\nHowever, for $31 I expected more about the history of the palace and Princess Diana and so on. The couture was gorgeous and I was able to see dresses that were worn by Met gala guests which was incredible. However, it’s not something that I would add to my list if your only in London for a short amount of time.","time":1699732123,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Stacie Kint","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114288448347011802093/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLcmppKyMDBdz2dQjpa6A9ZubssKfwvkhGexq-epA6y=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 weeks ago","text":"Took a tour of inside.
