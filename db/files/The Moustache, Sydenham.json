Close to home and secretive enough for me. As much as I want to see this place busy, i love how it does have its serenity.\n\nI found \"The Moustache\" by chance and so happy I did of course.\n\non entry you'll step in and be like \"aaaah\", it instantly feels cosy, has a rustic theme to it with odd chair sets and tables, bare wood flooring and exposed brick work.\n\nAs this place is owned by an Artist, you will see art work which is for sale on the walls.\n\nMusic played in the background is a perfect volume and old school jazz music. It feels a bit like a step back in time when youre hear. I find it hard to leave when I have the intention to stay just for a short while...oh well.\n\nCoffee is well made with a good coffee bean, not the fruity stuff but good proper coffee.\n\nhomemade cakes, which I found to die for! is it wierd I had it with a beer.\nyes they serve beer, bottled, canned (Brixton Brewery/Ignition Brewery) and on tap too (Electric IPA).\nAs well as Prosecco, wine, red or white and gin.\n\nFood menu is seriously tasty. Might sound the same as options you get in other places but its done really well.\nTheres a morning to afternoon menu and then one for the evening.\n\nIve had poached eggs with chorizo slices, on sourdough toast and smashed avacado. Presentation was on point and very artistic, portion size is great and and tastes all amazing! not exaggerating.\n\nAlso had a butternut squash and ginger soup thats served with toast.\nCarrot cake!!!! too good and finished my afternoon off with a cheeseboard for two hahaha but it was just for me.\n\nThis cheese board is like no other. Homemade crackers, chilli oil, olives, garnishing, chorizo, cheese and a few interesting dips to really spoil you.\n\nsee photos for proof. You'll enjoy your experience!\n\nThey have a baby buggy parking railing outside, play room downstairs for kids, unisex toilet.\n\nOnce a month they have a film club on with projector screen, havent tried it myself yet but will do.\n\nHope you enjoy it as much as I have. Definitely a returning customer!!!!\n\nyou wil get lost with time in here if you have a book.","time":1582402547,"translated":false}],"user_ratings_total":120,"website":"https://linktr.ee/TheMoustache99"},"status":"OK","place_id":"ChIJo1QNBDkDdkgRmeCZTu9O69A","address":"99 Kirkdale, London SE26 4BL, United Kingdom","categories":["soft play"]}
