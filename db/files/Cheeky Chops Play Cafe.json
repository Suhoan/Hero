Due to bad weather, we needed to make a quick very last-minute plan and the owners bent over backwards to pull a party together for us at the eleventh hour. The children had a ball - and the adults were well catered for with their much appreciated booze license!

The soft play is great and the coffee is delicious. We have come to cheeky chops a lot over the last year or so and it really is such a great place to bring young children.
