From the early settlers, the monarchy, and the rise and fall of the abbots by king Henry VIII to owners of the house from the 1920's onward. Did you know that Mahatma Gandhi visited the place? A showcase of cultural diversity through modern times and the importance of the Ford motor company has had on the local community in Dagenham. The staff were courteous and considerate throughout our visit. Some events occur all year round, so pick up the event's pamphlet. Well worth a few stops as there is so much to see and experience. I should also mention they have a modern-day cafeteria and indoor and outdoor seating, well-kept sanitary toilets, and a souvenir shop to boot. Valence House has open-air gardens that have loads of seating and a place for tranquility. Parking is found at the Valence Park entrance leading to Valence House. I shall visit again.","time":1660963519,"translated":false}],"user_ratings_total":322,"website":"http://valencehousecollections.co.uk/"},"status":"OK","place_id":"ChIJBZCYlFKk2EcRT8gE6G5bw5w","address":"Becontree Ave, Dagenham RM8 3HT, United Kingdom","categories":["museums"]}
