There is little lake within the park you can do boating. Cafe on site you could get food and drinks. Ice cream is Â£3 a scoop, 4 for the sugar cone which is really expensive. Play park is pretty good size and your children can have a play in it. Toilets are right next to it. There is a gallery next to cafe but we didnâ€™t check it out. There are various courts for cricket, tennis and football. Outdoor gyms are also available. Main path of the park is in good condition, it will be good for skating and skating boarding. Parking spaces are free within the park for 4 hours which is really convenient.","time":1675012324,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Joyce A","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114795010247759703340/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUAEQLr5ySBzzT_WZA9lNPuL5FnD8-rslj7KTFLeDAxWjZm=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"6 months ago","text":"Lovely location.
