It means you need to pay 60p each swim to store your items then retrieve your soap and take a shower at the end of your swim.

Probably 50% of the time I go to use the pool it's unavailable or getting cleaned. The lockers are not great and you have to pay everytime you use them and they have taken my coins without me being able to use it properly. Pretty much just annoyed to have to pay for a gym and pool that I can't guarantee will be available. As half the time the gym is too busy for me to do a full workout too. Idk why there are so many treadmills that waste space. The classes are also at inconvient times and always busy  and the one I did go to was packed and supposed to be legs, booty, abs and ended up just being a dance to the beat class which was fine just not really for me unfortunately","time":1699203275,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Helene Maloigne","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113222133350766951315/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXN4hFQFw9oFwY9zM-jLVAqP0ljaLYx-YA3BEgloOKt2P8=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"5 months ago","text":"Went there to use the pool so this review does not reflect conditions in the gym. The women's changing rooms are filthy. The floor hasn't been cleaned properly for a while as is clear from the lighter colour under the benches. Clearly no cleaning is done on a regular basis during the day, judging from the amount of hair, rubbish (including panty liners) on the floor. The pool area itself is clean.\n\nStaff are rude. The person on the desk just about acknowledged my existence enough to take my payment. When I told about the state of the changing rooms when I was leaving, they just turned away and ignored me.\n\nI think it's a rip-off to charge for the use of lockers!

This is clearly misdescribed on their website, as are their opening hours. One of the women/lifeguards with an Australian accent was rude and argumentative. She also seemed to ignore what information appeared on their website.\nI was having quite bad back problems on the day and needed to swim but this was not possible due to their restrictions. This is supposed to be a public swimming pool open to all and encouraging people to pursue sports activities. It is not acceptable to exclude various groups of people from using the facilities altogether at different times of the day based on their gender or health. There are discriminatory practices taking place here. Branding these exclusions as \"inclusive\" is insulting, while describing them as open to people of all ages or abilities is mis selling.\nBeing rude to paying guests is also unacceptable. We would suggest that the offending member of staff undergoes further training on her customer service skills as well as centre-specific information or at least she refrains from arguing. Ultimately, an obnoxious person is not suitable for a public-facing job.\nThe changing rooms were also poor, small and cramped with only 3 showers. The one I used didn't lock while another one was too small. There was a huge pushchair parked in this small space and on the way out there was a boy in the female changing rooms...\nThis is an overall unacceptable swimming pool that doesn't fulfil its purpose and by far the worst out of all the \"Better\" ones that we have tried. \"We hope that Better\"'s suitability to run this swimming centre is re-examined.","time":1690064845,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Elena Williams","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117446824657454047128/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKgiTvJO-0xWDy22pskvFrRVFrOfTRxNW1O1OnrQODq=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":3,"relative_time_description":"4 months ago","text":"As you'd expect from a local non-profit leisure centre. Friendly staff, nice instructors. Some classes/instructors are cliquey, but overall they're good and the other members are friendly. Gym is OK, but not much floor space for stretching. Not an insta or tiktok gym, fortunately. Great pool when not busy, but I'm often sharing a lane with three people, and not everyone follows the lane speed instructions, so it can be incredibly frustrating and not a great swim. More could be made of the pool, like aqua aerobics and HIIT classes, the big names gyms do much better at this.
