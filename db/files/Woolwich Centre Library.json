The rule that has been implemented (10 kids at a time until the end of term) is quite stupid, if i must say so myself; by the end of the term i will no longer continue having my exams, furthermore, there will be no point of me returning back to the library once the season of my exams ends. I am usually very late to arrive to the library, later than others, meaning i can not enter the library since the limit has been reached. This rule is very inconsiderate to the students who are there to improve on themselves and to gain more knowledge, it occurs so often that other students have to suffer because of misbehaving pupils and i am quite frankly tired of it!","time":1687713943,"translated":false},{"author_name":"• Ocexne •","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106706551555893603834/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocK93Lc1BxFLhOBdAWpE07Tr_n9yBeOvRyXvOsi_vkqupw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"5 months ago","text":"Why did you decided to pick out a little number of misbehaving pupils to represent a field of students? The recently established rule, which states that only 10 students may be admitted at a time till the conclusion of the term, is utterly callous and dehumanising. By denying secondary school pupils access to the library's study materials because of a tiny number of misbehaving students, you have figuratively staged them all as wild animals. Remember that not everyone has the right tools at home to employ for academic success, thus the library serves as a second chance for us. Speaking of specific tools, can't the library identify the precise students who made a disruption using tools like cameras? Wouldn't an adult who disturbed the library have been banned if it had been them? Why is it unique to us? By limiting the number of kids entering at once to 10, it creates a race to get to the library first. In addition, the students who caused a disruption STILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENTER THE LIBRARY AND MAKE YET ANOTHER DISRUPTION. Do you not realise how absurd this is? Additionally, when I went to the library with a few other students to study for mock examinations, they claimed that they were only trying to \"look out for the peace of the people in the library,\" or something along those lines. Am I not a person? Sorry, but that strikes me as being incredibly dehumanising. Why is everyone to blame for someone else's error? If that were to happen to you, I'm confident you would not like it very much. I'm tired of the prejudice you people have against us, and I'm tired of having to punish everyone for someone else’s wrong-doing. The fact that you did not take the time to go about this the right way irks me. Those students still have to advantage of entering the library as long as they get there on time. What a stupid ideology.","time":1687727743,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Eliza Rai","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112572793224634315369/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJSCQ7qvywb4zviLaX1ox7PsA3TDR7wbmmanKMr9zU2nw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"a week ago","text":"Man in the ladies' toilets, stay away from this place, the security guard didn't care\n\nUnsafe to go here, don't take your kids here","time":1700926393,"translated":false}],"user_ratings_total":130,"website":"https://www.better.org.uk/library/london/greenwich/woolwich-library?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=google_my_business"},"status":"OK","place_id":"ChIJ4___6uyo2EcR1ccxca4AIz0","address":"35 Wellington St, London SE18 6HQ, United Kingdom","categories":["libraries"]}
