Very informative guide who gave us the history of the place. Three-acre site om three floors with a basement. Great for children as there are several activities they can do throughout the house and in the grounds. It is well set-up for school and group visits. The information in the house touches on education, science and fashion. The gardens were nice and they have bees! Rainham Hall honey may be coming soon! Great cafe and outdoor area too. Nearest overground is Rainham Station or 287 bus from Barking Station.  Suggest visiting Eastbury Manor on the same day as they are relatively close to each other. Definitely worth a visit.","time":1689964144,"translated":false},{"author_name":"J C Giles","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111985427683513641806/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJok_jOZt9sDD2-_6katEvEIG5cJRDcii-YnmdOOD5h=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"Lovely volunteers, great cafe, gardens nice  quirky building.

Lots on offer for young kids and school groups. Beautiful gardens. The present focus is on the last tenant Anthony Denny, an interior designer who lived there in the 1950/60s. The cafe badly lets the experience down. We ordered hot paninis, a tuna melt and a ham & cheese melt. They were both truly awful. Hardly any filling and the tuna was a nasty paste ðŸ˜› and not cheap! The server who gave us a hot chocolate couldn't even be bothered to put it on a saucer and I had to lean over the counter to get one!
