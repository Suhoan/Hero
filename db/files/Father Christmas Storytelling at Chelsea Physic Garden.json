The thing is that it's more than just a space for pretty plants. Instead it's a living laboratory for research into the numerous ways in which plants are beneficial.\n\nOf course it is also a garden and a very pretty one at that. You can easily spend an hour or two wandering the beds and reading the surprisingly informative labels. And if it rains there's a very nice cafe where you can shelter.
