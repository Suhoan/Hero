Great price and perfect on a hot day.\n\nGreat splash pool for younger children (under 10) who just want somewhere to splash and have some fun.

The children don't notice, but both times I've seen that under / round the back of the slides are full of a build-up of dirt/grub. Today, I noticed the pool floor was generally very dirty.
