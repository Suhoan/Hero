It was very interesting, with a lot of information about the history of the Foundling Hospital and its founder, Thomas Coram. A volunteer, Lindi, was very knowledgeable about the museum and items in it. The most moving exhibit was about the tokens which mothers used to leave for their children. There is a room on the top floor devoted to Handel, who was a trustee of the Hospital.

Nestled in the city's heart, it offers a unique glimpse into the past, unraveling the touching tale of the Foundling Hospital. The blend of classic and modern design creates an inviting ambiance. Handel's role in supporting the hospital, coupled with his handwritten music scores, adds a personal touch. While the exhibits are emotionally resonant, a bit more interactivity would enhance the experience. Nonetheless, this museum is a serene haven that unveils London's past and the intertwined threads of charity and art.","time":1691999134,"translated":false},{"author_name":"carol lebold","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105062420291627550430/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUycOq859fURH6sfj5y6VkHHRd7Z6RSk1jzsS5pDF2jMKI=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"Both heartbreaking and inspirational.
