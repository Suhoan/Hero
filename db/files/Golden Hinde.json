It looks authentic, and it should, because it‚Äôs a replica of the original sailing galleon captained by Sir Francis Drake. It certainly looks the part, and at first I wondered if it was an original. But after thinking a bit more I realised there was little chance a vessel this old from the 1500s could still be in such pristine condition. While it is a replica, it is also an actual sea faring ship that has seen a good amount of real ocean sailing. Anyway it really is an impressive sight that you should check out when in the area.","time":1693013925,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Luke Blakebrough","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113529636099677574500/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWwLHycDNwLqnxm_ulkIU1QxdoH5aOPOw17lzqEQaEpgtU=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"We took 100+ kids here on a school trip.
