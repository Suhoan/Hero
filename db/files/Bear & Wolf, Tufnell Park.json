I ordered the tomato basil soup and the slow-cooked beef rib, and pulled brisket pie. Both were incredible!!! Paired amazing with a glass of the Rioja wine. My cousin ordered the fish and chips, cooked and seasoned well. My sister got the nachos which she enjoyed. 10/10 recommend. Andy was our wonderful server.
