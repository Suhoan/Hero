I ordered the mackerel set menu and an oat matcha latte. The set menu was so refreshing and light, but really filled you up - it tasted so homemade and healthy!! I forgot to take a picture of the matcha latte but it was served in a beautifully handmade mug (most of their ceramics were handmade!)\nI came here in May so was able to sit outside in the sun and enjoy the view of the river. The location is great as itâ€™s tucked away and private. The staff were so lovely and it was nice to be able to order and talk to them in Japanese - It felt like I was back in Japan.

It's like a comforting hug in the form of food. If you're after some genuine, no-fuss Japanese grub, this is your spot.\nRice Balls: These little delights? Spot on. Perfect texture and just pure yum.\nUdon: Whether you're in the mood for something hot and cozy or cool and refreshing, they've got you.\nSoba Buckwheat Noodles: If you're trying to keep it on the healthier side but don't wanna skimp on taste, these are a win.\nOh, and if you're a tea lover like me, their selection is on point. Matcha desserts? Yes, please! Sweet without being too heavy and that matcha kick is just right.\nBut the real MVP for families? The kids' play area. It's such a cool spot for the little ones. Love seeing families chill, with kiddos having a blast.\nSo, if you're after a chill spot with straightforward, delicious Japanese bites, give Toconoco a whirl. It's got that friendly, community vibe that keeps me coming back!","time":1696674704,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Lilac Penafiel","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112218906608087094602/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX6YJaKyMvVw0InHdC0VNeqchuAV65xAI0i4MH6ZIXQBBE=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"6 months ago","text":"Nice atmosphere and it's definitely for families as there are play areas for the kids (and actually at the time of my visit, kids are just playing around the cafe ðŸ˜„).
