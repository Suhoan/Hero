I even asked the SW at school to contact you guys regarding her injury but you didn’t respond to her email either. The communication is poor and there was more than one occasion that the Log Cabin have done exactly what I have asked them NOT to do. You should not be looking after children with severe needs if you can not ensure their safety, like your OFSTED report says. By our own experience at Log Cabin, I would say the OFSTED report is more than fair. You compromised my daughters safety more than once and then couldn’t be bothered to get back to us. Quite shocking. Hopefully there can be a huge improvement for all the other children who go there still.","time":1579775594,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Naima Ibrahim","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110328552334950791297/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKEP84KFI-LzuMa1Ji6Xi3hZgBaCkZOskTNmeSocvD8=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"6 years ago","text":"I have a daughter with special needs attending log cabin and she's taken care of very well.. the staff are friendly and helpful and very supportive to parents.
