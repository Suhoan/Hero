Our group had 3 babies, 2 of 11mo and 1 of 7mo so all in a spectrum of sitting, crawling and pulling up stages.\n\nThe whole floor is majorly padded with a soft mat and has a variety of toys all spread out, suitable from very young babies to older toddlers with pretend kitchen and shop areas and slides. I'd say it would fit comfortably at least 6-10 kids, parents included. Sandra the manager is very friendly and welcoming, offering us tea and coffees.\n\nThe sessions are 90-120mins long which is plenty of time to tire babies out, and there is space to park the prams. I hear the venue can also be hired privately, and sometimes include activities like messy play or sensory sessions. Would recommend.","time":1694701267,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Estera Ukowska","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107476450087727299375/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX7I82j8pGYLIqOlr0gT9KQz5xKZ8Qp7tDs2AsnbxrPimM=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 weeks ago","text":"Very nice place for any kind of family/ friend party.

Sandra, the manager, was absolutely wonderful to deal with, responding to queries quickly, helping with all aspects of the organisation and an amazing support on the day for everything from taking photos, engaging with the kids, helping make people comfortable and filming everyone singing happy birthday.

There are tons of fun toys in a supervised, enclosed area. I can grab a coffee from the cafe upstairs, find a comfortable seat, and just watch my son play while feeding the baby. The toys are sanitized between every session and there is a good mix for all age groups. The owner, Sandra, is a rockstar. She’ll play with the kids, hold your sleeping baby, help put coats on, and even run upstairs to fetch your coffee if needed. Plus, she’s just good company if you’re desperate for adult conversation. I’ve also attended a few of the classes here and they are really quality. It’s a much nicer setting than the usual cold and echoing hall or church those classes are usually in. I’ve been coming here for 2 years and will definitely keep coming back.","time":1621595528,"translated":false}],"user_ratings_total":38,"website":"https://avocuddle.business.site/?utm_source=gmb&utm_medium=referral"},"status":"OK","place_id":"ChIJeYfCFnqp2EcRC46j01mpBx4","categories":["play cafes"],"address":"The Star of Greenwich, 60 Old Woolwich Rd, London SE10 9NY, United Kingdom"}
