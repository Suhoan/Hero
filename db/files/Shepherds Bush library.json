Small and cramped not as big as the photos people.have posted on Google reviews. The study areas are limited, and packed during school holidays. Also, I think they have a lot of crimes here (based on all the notices about theft). Even though the pandemic is over, there were people coughing and sneezing in here, and that explains why a lot of people were wearing a mask. This is in 2023! I think it is because it is so small and cramped. Also, the library is very close to the actual main road, it doesn't have that warm and cozy library feel.  However, the one staff member I spoke was extremely polite ans helpful, but I really can't say anything good about it.","time":1684171284,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Marty Free","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102437150495228095293/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVTs3txNiLOmhkrni3oFaxiFtJF8nN84Yy9y3bdZ7QuBIc=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":3,"relative_time_description":"11 months ago","text":"Not great.
