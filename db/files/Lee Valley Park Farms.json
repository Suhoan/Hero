I didn’t know this place existed and expected just a small farm but it’s really big and has lots to see. We went during ‘toddler fest’ and there were different shows happening throughout the day so our little girl got to see a Ms Rachel impersonator which she loved. The biggest surprise was how everything was free once you were in (except food and the gift shop of course). But there were 2 rides and the shows were also free which was great. The staff were all really lovely and helpful it was a great day and we’ll definitely be going back on a day that the weather is much nicer.","time":1690280233,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Drelb 370","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105969323376637304732/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocI-NDQv-HkKGVIOOVyAN-qhxxPmaa8vW8qaRklj-0gl=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"3 months ago","text":"Great find in the outer London countryside.
