children.\n\nThe reference section is downstairs and is very peaceful.  The fiction section have good signage, staff reviews and recommendations are on display.\n\nThis is more than just a library, it also serves as a social hub for the local community. Recycling bags are available as well as free local newspapers.\n\nI love this little library and I feel it‚Äôs much better than Marylebone liberty but it is not as vast and has less facilities than Swiss Cottage library.\n\nStaff are friendly, extremely helpful and knowledgeable.","time":1590739344,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Charlotte Ford","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103234151552732664273/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX8_-k-j28qgxaFgyMruk3b1ChBBs1eT1J9wMDUfdiQWkJe=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"Lovely little library with friendly staff! Very helpful towards me, I'm not sure what other people have experienced but i have always have a pleasant experience here. My little boy loves coming here and choosing some books and playing. They even have lego play days and the staff are excellent with children.\n\nThe small space is very well used, some other reviews on google talk of the size being an issue, however they can't help the size of the location they have been given and unless you want to lose a library I recommend giving some support rather than letting one or two people's experience with the security guard (who isnt an ingeral part of this library and is transient in his position anyway!!) and the size of the library impact the overall review of a very important part of the St John's Wood community!\n\nSt. John‚Äôs Wood is a very expensive location and ground rent is high so this cannot be helped!!\n\nThank you üôèüèºüôèüèº","time":1667635757,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Olivia Hooper","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107079403713271043391/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW35-D7bs1HVUpari5oMbTvQI2WfMxM4FeeBS-YCIkpvi8=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"Unfortunately I have a bad experience in this library. The library is very small, no real study space mainly due to the fact they are not making the most of tables that they have instead of moving books for people to study they actively fill the larger tables with books. Security Guard that is there majority of the time (he refused to give his name) is very rude and won't be reasonable and allow you to use space whilst it's empty, even after I explained I would be happy to move as soon as someone needed to use space for computer access, I have seen him multiple times on different occasions be unnecessarily abrupt with a bad manner when addressing people. I understand that rules need to be followed and he has a job to do, but there is such thing as a happy medium and compromise and the least he could do is speak with respect and camly to people. I have also written a formal complaint about him to district council. Overall you get the impression from this library that they want people to spend as little time as possible in there which is a shame. As a young adult I think this is very sad, I don't know anyone my age that goes to libraries  regularly and you would think they would want to encourage this as much as possible...","time":1642190385,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Parisa Mahmud","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106773984999562502030/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKFEFHYfLm6pEr7veXBeB7IEh-Zc8NBHl68--xKrsfF=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"7 months ago","text":"Some staff more helpful and fair than others depending on luck on the day you visit the library.","time":1682789991,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Trever Massicott","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116379718613011318202/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocI0iDW9PRuLzqPdUuZaOja2VjQtppjNz20uZp5c6ZZg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":3,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"Pleasant place, bit small,place has a disorganised feel due to upheaval of covid.african security guard seems too strict and excitable in his job because my phone rang unexpectedly, I said call later, hung up and he told me to go .","time":1650041178,"translated":false}],"user_ratings_total":30,"website":"https://www.westminster.gov.uk/leisure-libraries-and-community/libraries/st-johns-wood-library"},"status":"OK","place_id":"ChIJSXftsb0adkgR_klaeY8A5vk","address":"20 Circus Rd, London NW8 6PD, United Kingdom","categories":["libraries"]}
