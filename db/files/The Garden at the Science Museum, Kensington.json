There is SO much to see here no matter what your interests are. I loved the space exhibition so much. If you are a fan of the space and the universe then you have to come see the exhibition, it is the best! Even if you are not into space, I highly recommend coming here. There is so much to learn about all sorts of topics. There is a huge room about planes and flight which is very impressive. They have life sized planes of all different types including war planes. There is also a cross section of a Boeing 747 which was so interesting. Every section of the museum is great and you learn so much from coming here. The staff here are nice and friendly and are always happy to help you. There are public bathrooms and food outlets all over the museum . Admission is free and I highly recommend coming here.","time":1700335911,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Rachel Dyer","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107833813937918866952/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU5_dt_SXJxomoWWQK1FVCK_tNJRwlDPs3s6JwBSyPQlXPq=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"2 weeks ago","text":"A great collection of items that have played their part in our engineering and scientific progression. We learnt so much and it's free! Don't forget to book your tickets though, I was lucky we went on a Friday afternoon and tickets were readily available to cover my mistake!\n\nA great space to explore with my 12 yo and 7 yo.  I've always enjoyed bringing them both 'The Garden' in the basement of the building when they were preschoolers.\n\nLooking at the space craft that Tim Peak travelled in was humbling and very interesting.\nAlso seeing how domestic technology has changed though the decades was eye opening for the kids. It definitely opened their minds and got them thinking as designers and engineers.\n\nWe didn't pay for any of the exhibitions on this occasion, though my kids were keen to go into the video game exhibition!\n\nThe picnic space on the top floor is a good size but after several schools had visited it was pretty messy - I felt the cleaners needed to be a little more on top of it.\n\nToilets throughout the building - no queues when we attended during term time.\n\nA great afternoon out in central London.","time":1700294211,"translated":false},{"author_name":"George Singh","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114347877063515361808/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocL03p0HWQS7GF68KrmNoVsUbHaMod7LZvS_y_lmAwai=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"a week ago","text":"Good educational day out for the kids.  Interesting pieces within the museum.  Does take a few hours to get round, best to plan a trip as can be busy.  Certain exhibitions cost money which is a shame.
