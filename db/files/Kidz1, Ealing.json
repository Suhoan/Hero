located in a nice area which is clean and easily accessible for all.\n\nHad to wait for to enter for our booked time slot as it was quite busy so ended up entering later than our booked entry time.\n\nThere are lockers available and I was asked for £1 to be able to use one.\n\nAnyway we were informed to wear shoe covers if keeping our shoes on however I witnessed several people wearing their shoes as normal and walking around without it being covered.\n\nThe place was nice overall, spacious and quite clean but I was not able to see any plug sockets since I had travelled over an hour to get there and use maps so my phone battery was very low. I was intending to take pictures and videos and couldn't do so as I was worried about my phone dying.\n\nThe cafe looked nice and complete however the prices are way too high for the food quality that your offering.\n\nAfter waiting nearly half an hour or more for my food I received over cooked popcorn chicken , chicken strips and the fries portion for just under £5 was very small(refer to the pictures)they were also cold and just thrown on top of the strips I had ordered even thought I expected it to come separately since it wasn't a meal.\nI was quite disappointed to have spent nearly £25 worth of food for it to be of such a poor standards. The drinks and snack prices are also way too high and not affordable for all! Imagine if you pay a lot for entry plus travel and you want to buy food/drinks/snacks for yours kids you will be spending over £100 just for this one day out! I was quite sad that this is the food but since my kids were hungry and we had already waited long enough I could not return the food.\nYou should consider doing cheaper meal options to suit all or at least smaller kids meals that will be more reasonably priced.\n\nIt was a nice experience for us to use the play facilities but there was no candy floss machines, nor was the cinema section open upstairs which we were hoping to see/try both.\n\nThere is also a strict policy for session times and you are not allowed to take any food/drink from outside otherwise there is a fee applied.\nAs well as a lost ticket fee.\n\nIt's nice that they are organised in these strict rules but I believe that you should bare in mind no everyone can afford to pay £50 just for one meal for their family of 4 Or More besides the entry fee on top of that.\n\nWe left early because we didn't want to lose track of time and be late to pay a fee...\n\nAlso it got abit repetitive after a while and kids were still hungry since the food wasn't fully edible.\n\nI would consider going there if I were to be in the area in the nearby future but I would ensure to eat before going or after the session ends.\nOther than that I will not be making a special journey out there unfortunately.","time":1698432089,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Nosila Facepainting","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112242507828787421562/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVzIsO0O5z24h18weuzQPKNEIJKKOAniCOywqoBVBxdkA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"Been here to do event decoration and facepainting for a birthday party and highly recommend here !
