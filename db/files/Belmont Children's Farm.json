The animals look really well cared for with large open paddocks for many of the animals. I visited here with my elderly disabled mother. Although not advertised on their website I got in free as her essential carer. The farm is on a bit of a slope. A member of staff gave us a lift on the electric buggy down to the bottom of the farm. The paths are quite sound but are mainly gravel so could be a bit tricky for some people with mobility issues. The visit provided good entertainment for about an hour and a half. Staff were very friendly and helpful.They sell bags of feed at reception and it is great fun feeding the Llamas and greedy goats.","time":1688313015,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Georgeta Buhnila","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118029152255440047325/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVpTBPcLS22xyEZPVFT3KTL1o25VvwekR1_T0Zq4_d0lAQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"3 months ago","text":"We been here on the weekdays.\nA nice place to spend few hours with the little ones.
