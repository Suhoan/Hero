One thing that's annoying is that we booked a table for £10 and when we got there it was never crowded so we never really needed to book or pay £10 and we wish we knew that or the £10 would be put towards a tab that would be better.

Up there looked like a mini rooftop Bavarian Christmas Village not going to lie. Very unique with igloos and served hard winter drinks. Now fast forward to 2023 I came here for the first time during the summer time just to have a glimpse of the sunset with a refreshing mocktail. Getting inside can be a bit tricky since it’s situated on top for a multi storey car park. There’s lift and staircase access to reach the rooftop.\n\nWhat I liked about skylight tobacco dock is that it offers jaw-dropping vistas and fun-packed experiences make your celebration with an unforgettable moment. So do take a deep breath and step out onto London’s most atmospheric skyline.","time":1690275146,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Gary Sawyer","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107672408021436953452/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWz--F0KywtGQMYgIfVEKi-RFnSC0JxWbGv3R2R4wmG9Ytj=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"5 months ago","text":"Some repetition on the bikes but a lot of unique one-offs.
