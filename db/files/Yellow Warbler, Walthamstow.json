I thought it was a great idea having a cafe with some kids bits in. Unfortunately the woman serving was incredibly rude, myself and my friends couldn’t believe how we were spoken to. She barely even made eye contact. Do not expect a warm welcome if you have kids. She even told us that there was a legal amount of prams they were allowed in the venue which I’m not convinced is a real thing. We offered to fold prams up and move them out the way but she barely even acknowledged we were talking to her. I understand that it’s not always possible with a larger group with kids but to have been so rude is not acceptable. Such a shame.","time":1699641079,"translated":false},{"author_name":"SB PurevibeConsortium","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117046547257301837978/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVWzoEhIixxNNYPkb1AazqKhefTvGUepdF4Ae-uAiP2mng=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":2,"relative_time_description":"3 weeks ago","text":"Popped in to grab an early lunch because my usual was closed.\nEverything was very expensive (£9.50 for a kimchi and cheddar toastie?!) so I opted for a basic mozerella and tomato sandwich baguette for £7(!!)

It was fairly warm out so I didn't want a hot drink but there were no cold drink options either. I'm not really sure why it was open at all tbh. I had some room temp water and stayed for a little while analysing the 'interesting' decor then left. I found when I got home that I'd left something behind and I've been back almost every day over the past week to try and collect it but each time it's been closed so the reviews about their opening times being inconsistent are probably accurate. Overall it's just average. If I needed a coffee and was walking past, I'd go for it, otherwise not ideal for anything else.
