I came here first time with my daughters (aged 5 & 6) and throughout the whole time here we had at the workshop, it was amazing! The girls loved getting involved and making slime, it was fun!\nA big shout out to Kai he was brilliant! As an instructor, he was very interactive, polite and funny. He gave a very good explanation at the start and instructions to all the children. Also, I didn’t catch the other lady name who put the aprons on the girls again lovely smile and spoke so nicely to the children. Children loved having Kai, he engaged thoroughly with both adults and children, if we had any questions he would respond quickly. Overall, a brilliant experience kids enjoyed it will come again!","time":1699224335,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Women's Wellbeing","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115239808025949649281/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXrz4jWI4e0duuTcSQnRSBVV3HKY1i78zeeonSwjSXJcA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"3 weeks ago","text":"Lucy hosted a glow in the dark slime party for our daughter and her friends.
