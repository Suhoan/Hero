prices were also ridiculously cheap; however when going to order my toddler some food the lady behind the counter quite rudely said \"no it's busy come back later\" then walked away.\n\nOther than that it's quite a large place with loads of activites for kids & 2 private party booths for birthdays (which had their own little tables and seating).\n\nWould recommend for kids & would've got a
