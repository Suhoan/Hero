Not sure.\n\nMy partner ordered fried shrimp which he didn’t finish either - not because it was bad but because he ordered sides with it that did not come with the food.\n\nI ordered wings with hot ranch sauce and mozzarella sticks - again, the food LOOKED good but I did not enjoy these wings, they were not falling off the bone and were quite dry - mozzarella sticks were okay a bit cold.\n\nWhen the chef delivered our food we asked him where our sides were as we ordered two fries and onion rings and he said he’ll be back soon, he didn’t come back and we waited another 15 minutes before telling the waitress not to worry about them.\n\nBy the time they arrived we would’ve already finished our mains, there was really no point.\n\nDrinks - Ice Tea, Lemonade, a pint of corona and a pint of coke with a slice of lemon - my tip is - ask them for your drink without ice as they fill the glasses with 70% ice - you’re paying nearly a fiver for a glass of ice lol\n\nDecor - As it was so busy I didn’t really get a clear view of the restaurant but it looked okay. The toilet’s definitely need updating though. Looked like something you’d see in a football club / 1998 high school. Very outdated toilet decor.\n\nCleanliness - Again, where it was so busy I struggled to see how clean it was but our tables were clean. The toilets could’ve done with a scrub and some loo roll though.\n\nCost - £64 - it would’ve been more but we were given 25% off due to not receiving our sides and waiting so long which I thought was nice of them.\n\nCustomer service - Great. All staff were nice and friendly. Special mention to Lizzy. They were very accommodating and understanding and always had a smile on their face. Thank you Lizzy!!\n\nOverall - 5/10 - probably wouldn’t return based on my comments above but it could’ve been worse.\nThank you Red Dog!","time":1688278982,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Riadh Barkat","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106101560143853894842/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX0pe59LR6TLe7k22XIJFnFnq6eBx65siuosNgWfV--Dls=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 weeks ago","text":"Dog Friendly spot.
