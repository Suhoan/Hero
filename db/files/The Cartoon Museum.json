Some brief biographies are provided for relevant featured cartoonists - however, in terms of educating yo-self fulsomely about the history and development of cartoons, strangely this museum doesn't quite directly do that. Perhaps fittingly, the present-day cartoons and merchandise for sale in the gift shop are very political - much of it anti-Tory. Perhaps some bipartisanship wouldn't go astray, as I consider all sides of politics worthy of lampoonery. The entry cost perhaps needs to be revisited as the collection was not uber-extensive and a saw with my own eyes a man walk in, and heard with my own ears the man ask how much a ticket was, before he promptly left.","time":1690888859,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Adrian Tooth","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103964876346881963024/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVTaAr9AydsDRG5Wj81L9ySKEP1kyRboO0HK6uSSUfY3WY=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"If you like your comics, political cartoons or animation, this is the place to head for. When I was there this time in October 23, there was a display on by Aardman. The political cartoons are brilliant and you walk through the changes in styles and attitudes of UK humour and artwork. In the centre is the life size Spitting Image puppet of Roy Hattersley, made famous by his ability to spray the audience with spit when he talked. Another hidden gem, just off the busy Oxford Street that is well worth a visit.","time":1698835680,"translated":false}],"user_ratings_total":991,"website":"http://cartoonmuseum.org/"},"status":"OK","place_id":"ChIJjTedqjMbdkgRqmCmSy0Hveg","address":"63 Wells St, London W1A 3AE, United Kingdom","categories":["museums"]}
