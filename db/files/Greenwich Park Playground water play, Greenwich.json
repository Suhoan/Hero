Usually people visit (and so did I) to the Royal Observatory and Greenwich Meridian Line and the park around this famous tourist attraction. However, this playground is an absolutely fabulous for kids of different ages.This time of the year (3rd week of August), the playground is surrounded by trees, seperated by a fence from the main park. It's greenery. It has everything like Sandpit with water through pump, slides, swings, climbing structures for different ages, small tree houses etc. My kids loved it. There is a small pond next to the Playground and it offeres boating for both kids and adults. Boating time varies, it was closed when we been there in a weekday evening. Nice place for picnic in the park area.There is toilet facilities in the corner. The entrance is right behind the maritime Museum. Pay & display parking available in the street (Mon-Sat: 9am-6:30pm).
