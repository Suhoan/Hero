A bit disappointed with the pig feeding, the kids got one small piece of fruit to throw over the fence and that was it. The playgrounds are great and my kids loved the sand areas so we did end up staying for over 2 hours, but mainly because of the play areas. There was a \"pirate ship\" area but it was empty so not sure what that was about. Paid about £40 for the family ticket but wouldn't go back for that price.","time":1696671873,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Caroline Drury","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106364812499072537159/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW0UCSz_ENbfWXWmFlPB3MLZRC_P3b5aBTGLZAqNfgL-vLR=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"3 months ago","text":"Love park area for children to play in, it's really big park area aswell for all different ages of children. My children got to see Winnie the pig be feed, and all 3 was included in dropping her food on the floor for her which included as very informative talk about Winnie the pig. We also saw the otters be fed they were very sweet otters.\nLots of other different animals to see aswell.\nThe zoo is very well kept, with clean toilets also.\nOur family had a lovely day out at Battersea zoo and I'd love to come back soon.","time":1692884431,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Richárd Vámossy","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108868851221102008408/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWbmDUYq7MXRdyBbaV3hkpGsiT-KqAiYi3OoLPoTfUFAQKS=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"6 months ago","text":"Excellent place to spend a day at. Perfect for smaller kids and toddlers as there are plenty of various toys and a large sandpit too. It's located in the middle of Battersea Park so the best way to get here is by walk or bicycle. The tickets are cheap, however, they charge admission for children over 2 y.o.\nThe whole area of the park/zoo is not too big so it's easily walkable and can be discovered within about 2 hours, but the abundance of games and toys can secure more hours of fun here for families with young kids.\nTherefore, we can recommend this place.","time":1686341229,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Lucy Fraser (LucyF)","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110551329833955684856/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUUXKiHpbrekVqEsoGMcoMiyQy0aNwHu-QExfOKWNXCbQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"5 months ago","text":"Lovely little zoo with a great range of animals, they have little play sections for the kids.
