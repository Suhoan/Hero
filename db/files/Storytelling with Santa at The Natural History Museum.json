It's definitely a family-friendly place. We went during half term, the tunnel from Kensington Station was closed, not an issue. It's only a few minutes' walk from the station. It was super busy. There was a really, really long queue of people waiting. Luckily, we booked online prior to going, so we were able to walk straight in. Take a packed lunch or dine in at one of many cafes located in side the museum. The bathrooms were clean, and there was lots of staff around in case you needed help.","time":1698177286,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Yosef Citron","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106064904607580562822/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJp4fGiD7zh0tIuMISsWMEitfjoJOElyTnwhtjINKv4=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"3 months ago","text":"Possibly London's both most beautiful building and most amazing museum.

A long line of people, however wen went in fairly quickly when it opened.  We did not have a ticket as it was free to get in. But they do have sell tickets for different tours if the museum if you want to do that.  The museum is massive, and there is so much to see. It would take a week to look at each section properly. There are 2/3 floors divided into different times of the world. They have covered everything from insects to dinosaurs to animals to  fish and many more.
