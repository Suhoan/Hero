All of my children was dressed up as we annually go to use the rink as a family tradition for Christmas but when we arrived in good order we saw the rink as it was in a terrible condition could not be enjoyable for us as a family. Nobody wanted to take responsibility nor talk about any problems of the rink, although everyone agreed it was terrible to say the least, and when I asked about refunds to the staff everyone just pointed to everyone else until I eventually got an email address after complaining for about an hour. Very very sad to not be able to use as has been tradition for years with my family, and I can‚Äôt recommend it as it stands at the moment. In reality nobody wants to help when your there as there was no customer service at all‚Ä¶ All the kids were left disappointed, family day ruined and no help from skating managers on site at all as we had to leave with no kore then a email info address and talk of a no refund.

These might be older than the kids skating on the ice rink and one of the biggest problems here in London.\n\nBlades are not very sharp but they do their job just fine. I had no issues.\n\nPrice is steep but very common for London.\n\nI enjoyed skating here despite the downsides, one visit is all you need, wouldn‚Äôt recommend making this a regular skating spot.\nBest time to go is in the first couple of sessions as there wont be as many people. During my skate I had around 30 people on ice which allowed me to have some fun and not worry about bumping into other people.
