Also historically known as Three Mills Island, because it is encompassed by the River Lea and Bow Creek, Three Mills Weir Wall River, and the Prescott  Channel. The island (Green / park) is an open space and has a history dating back to the Domesday Survey 1086. The actual Three Mills were once industrial buildings - the C.18th early House Mill ( still remain and the main  tourist attraction ), the C19th Clock Mill, and a windmill - demolished in 1858. On Three Mills Green/ park are wide open well signposted footpaths and towpaths which provide good landmark pointers along your given walk üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è route. During my visit here on the 20/9/22, I found the location easily reached and shorter in distance just north of the island - park in the High Street ( A118) Stratford -  entrance from Danes Yard apartments ( Olympic Torch Sculpture opposite side ) then follow narrow bushy TOWPATH south towards the park entrance. There are some interesting modern sculptures and landscape architecture in the park/ Green. Local public events sometimes take place here, and the park itself free on entry. This location I integrated as part of my East London self mini - tours. It can easily be reached by TFL bus services in Stratford High Street nearby - I relied on bus stop (M) Warton Road eastbound No.108 and bus stop diagonal opposite Abbey Lane ( stop L) for 108 and D8 services westbound. There is Disabled access into the park. But from the High Street route the bushy sided towpath along Three Mills Weir Wall River is quite narrow and an uneven surface from this direction. More accessible and slightly closer from bus stop ( V ) in Hancock Road ( Tesco supermarket) - service D8 south/ westbound for the House Mill in Three Mills Lane / Three Mills Island Green - park.","time":1664369947,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Anna Petrenko","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117851648032107945945/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVhMSDVWfhszA-WMMLxfmal8D7Q8RspBI4VLEb_d7Utw7E=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"3 years ago","text":"Very unique and special place in East London. For a piece of tranquility and calmness - come here.  This place looks like from a fairy-tail with a dark brick mill houses, their white tops and beautiful willows on the canal. You can watch birds here - loads of ducks, swans, snobby cormorants and busy cranes. I discover this place when jogging and found the area ideal for any kind of physical activity, nice walk and morning yoga. You can get a tour in the Mill House - check the schedule. It is the oldest tidal mill in England, the tour is very entertaining and enlightening.
