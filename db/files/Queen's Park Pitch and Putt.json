After the golf course staff were not present at the club house and not answering their radio, we had to walk across the entire park to look for them. Once we found a member of staff, they insisted that the pitch and putt was closed and complained about us \"interrupting their lunch break\", despite the fact they were out and about on their feet and appearing to still be working. We mentioned the email saying they are in fact not closed, to which the staff member suddenly changed their mind and asked us to meet them at the club house in a few minutes.\n\n15 minutes went by and the member of staff never showed up. We returned to the pet area of Queen's Park where we had previously spoken to them, only to find he'd locked the gate and obviously had no intention of ever coming to let us onto the course.\n\nWe returned to the area by the pet zone where the staff's office was and found the same guy and another member of staff. We asked why they never came to meet us and they offered no explanation (clearly they were too lazy to do anything and just shut the pet area hoping we wouldn't return, probably something they do on a daily basis). We were then given comments by them like \"that's life\" and \"just get off the premise\", and they refused to answer any questions as to why they said they'd meet us but never showed up. They also refused to give us their names and claimed they have no manager we could speak to.\n\nThe staff clearly have no care for the job and are happy to lie to potential customers. Myself and my colleagues had taken some time off work for it and paid for parking too, only to be rudely denied entry and have our time wasted waiting for someone who was purposely avoiding us.","time":1695844325,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Thomas Smith","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106843961499292400985/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKmx3Ez2hZlGCWNGMSxdnGygJd_ovOxUjSP_cKj1WJM=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"6 months ago","text":"A fun and relaxed course.

In our case there was noone present when we arrived (before 5pm on Bank Holiday Monday (I had called earlier to confirm it was open)) so I again called the designated number and was very grumpily told on the that it was too late to play (despite the listed hours being til 630 and website saying last rounds one hour before park closes which is dusk/about 8 or 830 in summer. Only circumstances I can imagine this being any fun is if you have kids who like golf and you live nearby but even then the course is so poorly kept that you will lose so many balls in the rough and under the thousands of leaves not raked away.
