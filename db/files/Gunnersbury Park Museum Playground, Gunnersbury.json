It's certainly been gentrified since me and my friends would run riots on our choppers and tomahawks (ask yer folks), or playing sword fights with bamboo and getting chases off the park keeper (again, ask yer folks). You can now get coffees from a couple of stalls and there's a lovely cafe bar at the mini golf area I recently discovered that sells all kinds of refreshments including food, beer, wine and cider. Lovely place to walk a dog and it's never short of a dozen or two. The buildings are beautiful and the lawns nicely manicured, everything is sign posted telling you about the history.\nIt would be nice if they could hurry up and finish the tea rooms (or whatever it's going to be) near the boat pond as it's an eyesore, but otherwise an excellent park.","time":1698863782,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Daryl Law","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112831103655874770129/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXIuR2f0nlXxkT2t8R6mqqT8Jk2PrJUUoXbB1-QH1VWskE=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"3 months ago","text":"One of the best local parks in Ealing (if not outer central London).
