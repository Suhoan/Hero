The enclosures they are kept in are beautiful and well looked after aswell as the store itself. I am really happy I was able to get my first 2 pet frogs (Froakie and Loki) from this store.\n\nThey answered all my questions and took the time to help me understand everything they were saying so I could provide the best and correct care for my frogs. They also took the time to help me set up my tank with my drainage layer, tree wood and vine leaves, the frogs were secured perfeclty making the jouney home less of an anxious time.\n\nBoth frogs have settled in well and whenever I go in to buy food they always ask how I'm getting on as well as how both frogs are doing and if they are moving around, eating well, etc. Overall both husband and wife are extremely lovely people and i am very grateful I was able to use the store to get my frogs and equipment.","time":1665737388,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Ben Dawson","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104803173004356512564/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLgTseMSYAHmIDnRJZvjCLeLATKHEjZyZd6FKYYP6ox=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"4 months ago","text":"Just bought a fire salamander from Jurassic World Reptiles for my son who is a fairly prolific reptile/amphibian/arachnid keeper.\nThis place is outstanding.
