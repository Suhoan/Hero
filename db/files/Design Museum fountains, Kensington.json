Not like other museums. Though I did enjoy it, I felt like it was very niche. The exhibits were placed on the walls of each floor but I did feel as though it was quite bare on some floors than others. The most interesting bit was the exhibition upstairs tucked away in the corner but apart from that it did feel empty. I would say unless you really do enjoy design, then it would be mediocre at best.\n\nAll in all: good.","time":1698774463,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Amy","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105629832901269013933/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU1_cavmneNV2_8EPwervnablkt0D81dnZ8yqnGyvo48w=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 weeks ago","text":"Large, open modern space with different gallery themes.

The exhibitions are thoughtfully curated, showcasing innovative designs from various periods and regions. From iconic classics to contemporary pieces, there's always something new to discover.\n\nThe museum's architecture itself is a feat of design, making the visit even more enjoyable. Whether you're a design enthusiast or simply curious, this museum offers a fascinating glimpse into the world of design. Highly recommended!\n\nThe gift shop at the Design Museum is a treasure trove of creativity and innovation. From beautiful art books to unique home decor, every item reflects a commitment to design excellence.\n\nWhat truly impressed me was the quality and originality of the products. Each piece is carefully chosen, and there's something to appeal to every design enthusiast. While I was taken aback by the prices, which are quite high, I understand that this may be partly due to the current inflation situation in the UK.\n\nDespite the costs, I highly recommend taking the time to explore the gift shop during your visit to the Design Museum. Even if you don't plan to buy anything, the experience of browsing these carefully curated items is inspiring in itself.
