We were with Mitch and he was funny and considerate and kind. There are some spells and cool effect involved but we felt there could have been more (you spend much time sort of by yourself). The food was cute, but not a lot. The place is wizardly run down which has it's charm apart from on the toilets. We also had two \"unicorn bloods\" which are nice as you get them from the unicorn bartender, but IMHO not worth the money. Also, our event was basically over 28 mins before the set time with everyone else leaving, which was weird and sort of breaking the mood and magic a bit. Can recommend it as a fun thing to do once :) The people there are all very nice.","time":1692606918,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Francesca Santini","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111545149813071404833/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWvw6sqD-TstNqFZQRfnpVPGtVSMAr1pi8TbIeJIDQJ0zg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"4 months ago","text":"The atmosphere is lovely, the place is very magical.
