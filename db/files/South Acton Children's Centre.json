The teacher's approach of asking me to leave my child alone for 20 minutes, as soon as we got in, made my child uncomfortable, and he clung to me, not wanting to play. The teacher was pushy, pressuring me to leave him for 10 minutes, then 5 minutes, and finally proposed taking him from my arms. When they did take him, my child cried and was left on the floor, still upset.\n\nThe staff also misunderstood my child's previous playtime at home and placed him in the wrong group. The taster session with parents was chaotic, and my child needed more personal space. I felt that South Acton Nursery School and Children’s Centre's expectations for a 2.5-year-old to thrive in such a short time were unrealistic, and they lacked the friendly approach and time children need to settle. I explained this to the staff, but they didn't listen and gave vague responses. This experience left me frustrated and disappointed.\n\nEventually, we were told that they would not offer him a place and took the decision based ONLY on a 40 minutes class taster session.\n\nCHEVRONE was very unprofessional and Seibina Downes the Deputy Head Teacher did not even reply to my email describing the entire experience.","time":1699011937,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Farah Mjd","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104939435209660963893/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIuOfwFgxQYOlEfCQRlOBlsu9YNn_8fxigS3ABMjVR_=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"4 years ago","text":"Very pleased with all the services that I've received here, including the health visitor clinics and baby/children play sessions.
