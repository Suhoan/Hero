The museum is located in a Georgian townhouse that was Dickens's home from 1837 to 1839, and it is filled with personal artifacts and memorabilia that give visitors a glimpse into the life of one of England's most beloved writers.\n\nThe museum is divided into 10 rooms, each of which is dedicated to a different aspect of Dickens's life and work. The rooms are beautifully furnished and decorated, and they are filled with original manuscripts, letters, and other artifacts. There are also interactive exhibits that allow visitors to learn more about Dickens's writing process and his social commentary.\n\nOne of the highlights of the museum is the Blue Room, which was Dickens's study. The room is furnished with Dickens's desk, his writing chair, and his library. Visitors can sit at Dickens's desk and imagine themselves writing one of his famous novels.\n\nAnother highlight of the museum is the basement, which was once used as a kitchen and servant's quarters.\n\nThe Charles Dickens Museum is a fascinating and informative place to learn about one of England's most important authors. The museum is well-curated and engaging, and it is sure to appeal to fans of all ages.","time":1690613852,"translated":false}],"user_ratings_total":1879,"website":"http://dickensmuseum.com/"},"status":"OK","place_id":"ChIJlwm8OUgbdkgRWsaTM35CDTM","categories":["winter holidays"],"address":"48-49 Doughty St, London WC1N 2LX, United Kingdom"}
