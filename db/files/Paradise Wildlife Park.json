It was much bigger than I thought it would be.  The zoo was very clean and kept well and the layout and enclosures made animals easy to see while still giving them plenty of room.  No giant animals but still so many animals to see and a few I've not seen in other zoos.  We had lunch there which was reasonable and the burgers were really tasty. We played crazy golf which was fun and super cheap!  We popped into the speedway museum which was fantastic as we both love motorbikes and the gentlemen gave us so much information we learnt loads.

I last went around 25 years ago so it's claimed a lot. The gift shop was brilliant, the food was surprisingly nice and the animals looked well looked after. The enclosures looked really good and spacious considering it's a smaller place and we ran out of time for my 2 year old to go on the slides etc but she would've loved it. There's so much space so even when it's busy, you're not having to push past people. We spoke to a zoo keeper in the car park who had just finished their shift and he had great things to say about the place. He also said the staff know so much and love it when visitors ask them questions although people usually don't ask them as they think they're too busy. He said \"please ask us questions. We've always got time to answer questions about the animals\". Highly recommended and we'll definitely be coming back in the warmer months and with more of the family!\n\nWe visited on a Monday during half term in October for my daughter's 2nd birthday.","time":1698707796,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Jake H","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103173741467600804265/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXp1_L4d0BFkwfZUVmxtybp8ZaTjYfgvOu5652P_d6I-64=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"a week ago","text":"Kids absolutely loved it! I have a 4, nearly 5 year old boy and a 19 month old girl, and they were over joyed!\nWe had the opportunity to go during the week on a Monday, very little amount of people around on this particular day, which gave us plenty of space and opportunity to see the animals multiple times and the food hall was very quite as was the train ride and the kids climbing frames.\nIt was fantastic to see the kids' faces as they gazed into the eyes of a lion at eye level, they was tad nervous at first but soon understood that they are unable to enter our area and we are safe üòÖ\nI could write forever about each and every animal, but I will sum it up, very good day out, even with the very little people it took us all day to see the park (bare that in mind) , the kids loved to see the \"meerkat\" very funny little things, what the adults think of the animals pacing up and down the fencing we shall keep to ourselves , but it is very apparent and atvthe end of the day they are very well looked after.\nUnfortunately, the \"birds of paradise\" were closed for our visit, which was a tad annoying but not much you can do.\nThe food was OK, it's what you expected when you ordered a \"cheeseburger\" from an establishment such as this. It was OK, and I would eat here again if I was here and had no pack lunch.
