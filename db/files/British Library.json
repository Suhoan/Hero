Many sections have been closed off to the public and though there is an exhibition on the ground floor exploring the likes of religion, artists, architecture, Shakespeare, modern day writing all in literature form, it's a shame that not all of it is accessible in depth. It's a good thing entry is free to the public as charging for entry would feel like one big con. If you're a bookworm then this is the place to be but if you're passing through, the visit will be very fleeting, so just a head's up.","time":1701003716,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Tom Ford","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110954517105451982894/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVHOun2EAESz3zAYD6N37l5GfEzzB7Po1lUg_6DnTenPFt2=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"Cool place to go to see all things book related.
