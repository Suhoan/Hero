He provided such personalized and intimate communication of all sorts of information about the Globe. He included historical memorabilia, personable anecdotes, funny stories, and interacted quite well with the audience. The theater came to life via his presentation, and allowed an insider's look at the entire venue.

Amazing theatre with a rich history and absolutely stunning performances. Watched 4 plays already - Julius Caesar, Midsummer night’s dream, Macbeth and As you like it. All the plays had an amazing cast, amazing costumes and were beautifully played. Love the yard standing area - I think it’s the best way to watch Shakespeare plays at the Globe. Just £5 tickets and you feel like being part of the play rather than in the audience, with all action happening around you. It’s one of the things only London can offer and I recommend watching a play here for anyone visiting London! Book your tickets in advance on the Globe website as the yard tickets generally sell out very quickly. Also it’s open air, so do dress for the weather!","time":1698687625,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Hudson Hanson","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116735441467517520851/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUuCXAtwnJLHz9TGtvKt3vySE9w9L_evbsY38Zac6ZLLcwV=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a week ago","text":"This is an amazing historical building.
