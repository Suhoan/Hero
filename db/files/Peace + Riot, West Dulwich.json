The owner is constantly taking on feedback and evolving the offerings for the better. The peace keepers are great with my 10m old, very hands on and friendly. Although they might not be available immediately if they're with other children, they will come to collect him when asked and are very attentive. I've attended various events which have always been quite good, easy and nice to start chatting with other local parents. The food menu has gone through a few iterations and I think is now the best it's been. It's a wonderful and unique asset to have in my local area.","time":1635338854,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Ty Glaser","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101479921921771426136/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJtpMF39jo925-NHh5sgcax8QjqKZAQa6nDwkZfEiXD=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":3,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"Overall we definitely enjoyed our visit. I feel like the place needs a really good clean though. Floors, toys, bathrooms. The peace keepers were lovely and my 5.5 year old had a great time playing with them. All the staff were very friendly and sweet. I’d love it if the menu felt more like it had been completely cooked from scratch there though, fresh whole foods etc. It also would have been nice to be introduced to a peace keeper immediately upon arrival, initially we didn’t really know what to do and felt strange not knowing whether someone was going to be keeping an eye on our nearly 1 year old. My husband and I tried to get a bit of something done but for me it felt a bit too chaotic and because I wasn’t 100% sure there was one person allocated to be looking after our son I don’t think I could have actually worked at all. Probably better for kids older than 3 I think. Definitely a nice thing to do as a family on a weekend every once in a while.","time":1648411722,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Sarah Sharman","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103983527022616376713/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVsd_4QU6ZHUBI6QD7Y7xHpKLDlRKG320SMySuP4mRfmlxf=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":2,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"I specifically went to peace and riot with the child I was looking after as I had heard it was a great place for kids to play as adult sit back with a coffee.

It’s in a nice area, spacious and bright and the peacekeepers I met seemed lovely.\n\nDespite all this I don’t think I will come back for a good while… my daughter is currently in a cruising / crawling phase and the cafe is not particularly well set up for that - will be much better(safer) when she’s comfortably walking I think…she hurt herself badly falling over and I think it would be ideal if there were more soft areas/playmats where mobile babies like her could be more safely looked after… she was also very keen to crawl into the main part of the cafe - lots of food on the floor at the time so again not great for a crawling baby.\n\nSo overall I’d recommend for those with non mobile babies, or older ones who aren’t going to suddenly fall back and give themselves a head injury!","time":1648745289,"translated":false}],"user_ratings_total":41,"website":"https://www.peaceandriot.co/"},"status":"OK","place_id":"ChIJd3J8hncDdkgRSSIOjWLVejU","address":"12 Croxted Rd, London SE21 8SP, United Kingdom","categories":["soft play"]}
