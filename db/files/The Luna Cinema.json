Great choice of film - pride & prejudice paired with location chatsworth house ( filming location for the movie). Very well organised and all staff were helpful and friendly.

We got a little cold as didn’t come very prepared but they very conveniently had blankets available to purchase which were really good quality and can save it for our next Luna Cinema visit.","time":1692348902,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Georgia Franks","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116002098460186956524/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLYJUVW7KNEMyJ74SY4Yf26pKeWt7aK7s6x5DJU8Rly=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"3 months ago","text":"We went to the screening of Top Gun: Maverick at Kew Gardens and honestly had the best time.
