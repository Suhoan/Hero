It wasn't busy. The place is very nice, lots of greenery and flowers which make it look like a meadow. There is a small lake with beautiful water lilies and many benches along the path. The playground is very big, clean and well organized. There are water pumps, sandpits, swings, slides and obstacle courses. My daughter was very happy. There is a cafe and toilets by the playground. Parking is available in front of the park.\nThe only downside is the noise coming from the building site which is right next to the park. But for children who like to look at construction machinery, especially big cranes, it will be a lot of fun.\nNext to this park, there is another playground, as nice as this one, but without the water pumps.\nI highly recommend visiting this park with children.","time":1687898258,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Caroline King","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117973967231850075393/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW4amgv1YHS9JQFEcNlG5n-UVxmY7XWAAjZ6v7Me83W1vCX=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"3 months ago","text":"Had a great few hours with some older kids as we came here after a session at flipout and wanted to see what it's like. It has two parks one for smaller children but older kids can use it too, it's also good for children with additional needs as it's accessible. The park has a lovely huge pond as you walk through to otherside and some really good play equipment that's a little more challenging, also has water to play with but wasn't on at the time we went. Very clean area. Has a ice cream and snake bar and toilets within the park.","time":1691443645,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Shen S","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112326809340768587657/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVlEAnsPkEJTMwUlIQJc4QV9Co6djMQ5N_dd0TXl8hrtNk=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"3 months ago","text":"Absolutely loved this park!
