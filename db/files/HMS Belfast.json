week ago","text":"Missed visiting this on previous holidays, but this time around I finally got to see it. You can either have an audio guide or do a self guided tour and I opted for the latter. Despite having a map of the ship it was a little confusing at times as to how to access the various areas, which direction to follow and as a consequence I never made it to the engine rooms. You'll also have to descend and ascend a number of steep stairs if you want to access all areas, so if stairs aren't your thing you may want to forego visiting the ship. It's an amazingly well preserved ship, gives you a great appreciation of how the crew lived, what they had to endure and the various functional areas.","time":1701009500,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Martin Sikora","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113985293933273446531/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKulEhTB4vlBHo61dysi6M-ToLZjbdBWRHAXMoX1cDs=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"Great tour for marine fans.
