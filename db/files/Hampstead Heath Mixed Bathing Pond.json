It is decent for swimming and cooling off although it is not the prettiest, it has the advantage of being close to one of the park entrances from the Overground station, Hamsptead Heath. I recommend it to have a good swim before spending the rest of the afternoon easily taking the Overground to the center of Camden or Kentish Town. Tickets must be purchased, preferably in advance and they are not expensive, considering that they are intended for the conservation and care of the place. If what you prefer is to take a day off and get away from the hustle and bustle of the city, then after that swim, nothing better than going into the park, looking for a good place surrounded by greenery and sounds of birds and having a good picnic. I promise it can be restorative and very uplifting. Warning: bring pencils and a notepad; it can happen that our inner artist or poet emerges spontaneously.\n\nThe last time I went, I met with one of my favorite people after endless pandemic years and the environment allowed me to keep the memory of one of the most perfect days of my life. Now she is expecting a boy and I can't wait to spend new perfect days, the three of us.\n\nEternal love to Hampstead Heath.","time":1688501340,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Hcathy Tagmount","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105956865042134131603/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWSVgRnN6Mktumz6fruCBMuIA_vYUpLWRLXBcFmhRBbN9Hp=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"5 months ago","text":"Pond water swimmers about 12 to 15 degrees when we went.
