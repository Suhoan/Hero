The venue and its atmosphere is absolutely stunning and was exactly what we were looking for.\n\nWe had the entire building to ourselves which was great to spread out to get ready, serve drinks and mingle as well as entertain kids in a separate area while the main auditorium was turned around between ceremony, dinner service and party. While we were not too involved in the logistics as we were lucky to have a wedding planner, everything went smoothly and without a hitch. All our guests were impressed with the venue and we were almost happy about the pouring rain on the day which only added to the atmosphere!

Reminiscint of the old TV series The Good Old Days. A fine historic building.\n\nSaw The Merchant of Venice 1936. Which brings the Shakespeare play up-to-date against the rise of the British Fascists under Oswald Moseley between the wars. And the historic battle of cable street which occurred on the streets outside the hall. Where the good people of the east end, English, Irish Catholics, dockers, the African community stood with their Jewish neighbours to resist the black shirts of Moseley. A play sadly relevant today against the pretext of Palestinian rights demonstrations support the Hamas party which has denied the Gazan people the vote since 2008\n\nA worthwhile play which is touring England.\n\nA historic building to visit.","time":1700215255,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Robert Darling","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107867028360165343882/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXGAGfzQCUibjv62jWQDLx81UPj9n4hQ2qOYefmIFCjJEQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"5 months ago","text":"Absolutely wonderful place. Steeped in character, really good shows, plenty of bars with seating and food.\n\nWiltons is quite a historic place. Its run by a charity I think and although its probably structurally sound, it certainly shows its age. I liked the roughness. I really felt that I was going back in time.\n\nMy recommendation would be to look at whats coming up and find something you’ll like.
