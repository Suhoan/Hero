I'd recommend for children up to (young) 5s. I imagine children aged 6+ could get bored quickly. We were lucky enough to have the session almost to ourselves. It was just myself, my daughter and 1 other mummy and baby. We got stuck in and had a fab time. I noticed the very tired toys that people have mentioned in the other reviews. They seem to be hand-me-downs or toys that have been discarded. They could certainly do with a refresh but this didn't stop my 2yo from having a great time. I didn't try the food/drink but it looked nice. The reason I've given 4 stars is the tired toys and the lack of parking. Of course parking is no direct fault of Role2Play but it does impact the overall experience (i.e. ease and cost) as my 2 options were to either pay to park 10 mins up the road or pay Role2Play an extra ¬£4.30 for a permit. I paid for the latter, which brought the total cost up to just under ¬£14 for 1 hour and 15 mins. It would feel more worth it if the toys were in better shape. All said and done, would certainly come again if I lived more locally :)","time":1698782979,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Catherine and Daniel","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109281663439796304307/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLiEQAQUubvuuOy7YVQBOJ3SDUBdjlmfYA1kNfF-1SF=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"a week ago","text":"Enjoyed a nice afternoon here with my 2.5-year-old.

Some of the toys were extremely worn out could be cared for as it is a paid session. Unfortunately we weren‚Äôt allowed snacks inside which is understandable due to allergens. However my toddler carried water inside its hard to control children and unfortunately the staff were just too rude about half a cup of water. I mean water is not an allergen. I guess they have extreme policies which is obscure for parents with toddlers. Even to sing happy birthday was not permitted not sure what kind of play friendly they are. I think this was the moment we was made most uncomfortable as we was told her boss was on the phone and she was going MAD because we sang Happy Birthday and they had a different package, this was between 2-3 toddlers not a birthday partyü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüò≥\n\nReply to owner: Unfortunately I feel like I still haven‚Äôt made my point clear. I‚Äôm not disputing your rules however half a cup of water carried in by a toddler can happen without my control it‚Äôs the way I was told and stared at. Going back to your website your party rules, we did not light a candle we were fully aware we only opened the cake( small sponge cake) and sang a happy birthday. There‚Äôs a freedom of speech we can sing happy birthday anywhere, we did not want a 2.5 hour package!

It‚Äôs a great concept however after around 45 minutes my little one start to get bored as the toys end up everywhere - so you go to play in the supermarket for example and there‚Äôs nothing in there because children have taken the toys elsewhere; I understand this would be hard to manage but it is an issue in my opinion. I also feel the toys are a little tired and given the price paid to play I would expect better kept toys. After paying for a parking permit it‚Äôs around ¬£15 for just over an hour play. The play area is generally clean however at the end of our sessions while sitting in the cafe I have noticed staff tidying and putting toys back in place ready for the next session, I feel some areas need to be sanitised between sessions given that young children tend to put things in their mouth etc. Overall it‚Äôs worth a visit but once you‚Äôve been once it‚Äôs abit boring, perhaps a rotation of toys would help.","time":1700471674,"translated":false}],"user_ratings_total":158,"website":"http://www.role2play.com/"},"status":"OK","place_id":"ChIJ7zMSrBmh2EcRHNQZuy4Up9A","categories":["play cafes"],"address":"75 Fulbourne Rd, London E17 4EZ, United Kingdom"}
