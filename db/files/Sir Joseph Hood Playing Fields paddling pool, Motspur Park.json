If not, you certainly missed out on a lovely event. There were quite a few stalls and the live entertainment was fabulous. Lots of yoga, and dancing with JV Dance Fitness bringing the event alive with his fantastic dance moves. Great entertainment had by all. If you haven't been down to Sir Joseph Hood, it's a 2 hectare park, with a lovely play area with a kiddies pool and picnic area. There is also a small Putt Putt course (Mini Golf) and a soft play area.

They have 4 regular-size hoops and 2 smaller-size hoops. If you're looking to teach someone the sport I would highly recommend it as it can cater to all ages. People hardly play football but there are two hoops situated on the concrete football pitch. They have roughly 4 tennis courts, side by side where people are normally playing tennis. You have a big metal fence which separates the tennis courts from the basketball court and the rest of the park. There is plenty of parking so if you did want to drive there, theres free parking and loads of spaces. There is a big field which normally have either football or rugby events going on. It also has an outdoor gym, it does have public toilets aswell.","time":1689357140,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Kay Common","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110359385356133932894/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLy_f5dakXus6xHCZEWu0-RiYuZ0v5smHEMPQANWRn0=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"2 years ago","text":"Great outdoor space with many facilities on offer.
