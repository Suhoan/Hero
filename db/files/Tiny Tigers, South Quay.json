Come november, i booked her birthday party there and i was great!\n\nI like their soft play area because it doesnt seem cluttered and you get a bit of everything-soft play equipment for gross motor movement both for toddlers and crawlers; shelves filled with different toys like puzzles, musical instruments, etc and also get a section of the play space for role play. It was worth the price for the amount of things your child can do and try during your booked time.\n\nIt also gave me some peace of mind that all the toys were being cleaned prior every session and some of them are changed after. We are only allowed one parent to be with the child but understable given covid restrictions.\n\nI booked a pLay session and party in their den room. It was easy to communicate with them my requests and i had no problems during the day apart from there is no parking. My party was safari themed and they did an amazing job of decorating the space (in a short amount of time as there was a session before it) and went with the theme i requested. There were also safari themed toys for the kids to enjoy while there.\n\nThanks for making my little girls party an memorable one.","time":1636830198,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Belinda Goh","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105406847361267567053/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXjuFAMQS9Lzmcatd9sarADgJo1iEiWV5UEFQTpq1tNReo=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 years ago","text":"Lovely cafe and soft play.

The cafe also supports local artists by selling their artwork placed on the wall, which is nice.

Their soft play area is very spacious and includes variety of activities to keep the kids engaged for 1 hour. The Den was very well maintained and decorated by the lovely staff at Tiny Tigers. The team were involved with us in our requirements for the party and on the event day helped us various things like decorations, food setup and post event clean up.\nThank you once again Tiny Tigers for making my daughter’s birthday party memorable.
