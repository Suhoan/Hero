Everyone who works there lacks any enthusiasm to offer good service. A couple of the volunteers excelled but it did not make up for the shocking service in the cafe, 3 jacket potatoes later resulted in a refund and going hungry. The staff were clearly disgruntled and had no idea who was in charge. The toilets were filthy and the human waste on the floor and toilet seat there when we arrived in the morning was still there when we left in the afternoon. A completely wasted property in the portfolio and needs better management and care.","time":1694455261,"translated":false}],"user_ratings_total":4060,"website":"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/osterley-park-and-house?campid=GMB_Central_Website_LSE_Osterley-Park-and-House"},"status":"OK","place_id":"ChIJq0dcL2sNdkgRY5CNmDaGxyM","categories":["outdoor","historic"],"address":"Jersey Rd, Isleworth TW7 4RB, United Kingdom"}
