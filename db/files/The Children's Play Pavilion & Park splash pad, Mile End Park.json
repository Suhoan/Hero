You should be ashamed of yourself. LBTH needs to safeguard the childrens centre better. A white woman who arrived with a school aged child who admitted to not being the mother of the child and not from the borough was welcomed with open arms by Mary whilst an asian woman from the borough, clearly in need of the services, with 3 children was separated from her eldest child by Mary and the poor girl was left out in the rain. The centre was not busy and the little girl was not causing any problems at all.  I do not want my child learning that it is ok to exclude people based on skin colour. Shame on you Mary and shame on your colleagues for allowing you to behave this way. You are old Mary not stupid, you know exactly what you are playing at. Take a good look in the mirror.\n\nUse your policy correctly Mary, there was no guarantee that this white woman was telling the truth about who’s child she had brought in or why. There was no way to check who she was either as she was out of borough. For the safety of my child I left as clearly LBTH dont care about safety.
