They are severely encroaching on the see saw there and are evident outside the fences throughout the children's spaces. Don't let your toddlers run as wild and free as they are. LBHF needs to pay more attention to the essential maintenance in our much valued green areas. I'm tempted to take a weed burner out there myself. Nevertheless the lovely sand diggers in the pit are wonderful for children to use. Parents or Carers can sit on them too to guide little hands. The tree seat is a pleasant addition for bags and belongings as long as you keep an eye on them. Gates stiff to get through. You may need assistance if you have a big buggy. Older play area good range of equipment with music chimes, mirrors, huge climbing spiders web, group spinning swing and lots of physical challenges. NB close to North travelling traffic so if your child has a respiratory condition wise to take this into consideration.","time":1558251876,"translated":false}],"user_ratings_total":460,"website":"https://www.lbhf.gov.uk/arts-and-parks/parks-and-open-spaces/map-parks-and-open-spaces#Shepherds-Bush"},"status":"OK","place_id":"ChIJa2O4SsUPdkgR0bBmwQWydN0","categories":["playgrounds"],"address":"Woodford Court, 33 Shepherd's Bush Grn, London W12 8QZ, United Kingdom"}
